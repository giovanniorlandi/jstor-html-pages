THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21,1 922.\nFrom Pilot Knob.\nNot having been at home for the\npast two weeks, I failed to send In a\nfetter for last week\'s Register.\nSaturday night, December 2, Mrs.\nJ. T. Patterson received a telephone\nmessage that her mother, who is\nmaking her home with her eldest son.\nJudge W. H. Shy, near Black, Rey\nnolds county; was seriously ill and\nnot expected to live. The next morn\ning, Sunday, she and Otto started for\nBlack, a distance of nearly thirty\nmiles, arriving there at 4:30 p. M.\nThey returned home Tuesday follow\ning, and reported that her mother,\nthough in a very critical condition,\nwas somewhat better. If she lives\nuntil her next birthday in 1923, she\nwill be ninety-six years old, having\nbeen born in 1827.\nWhile waiting for the train one\nnight not long ago in a certain town,\n1 noticed quite a crowd gathered not\nfar from the depot. I concluded that\nI would go over and see what was the\nattraction, ana to my surprise i touna\nIn progress one of the so-called social,\nmodern dances. The last dance of\n. this kind that I had the displeasure of\nseeing, was six years ago, on a boat.\nThe Grey Eagle, on the Mississippi\nriver, just before these gay terpsichor\nean excursionists left the wharf for\n: Upper Alton, Illinois. I could not\nhelp but wonder where those tray\nparticipants would wake up, should\ntnat boat nave suddenly, witnoni\nwarning, gone to the bottom - of the\nriver,\nThose , "new tangled" dances are\nnothing more nor less than a legalized\nway of hugging and very indecent\nway of spooning and bellying. I will\nventure the assertion that if a man\nand woman should be caught on the\nstreets or elsewhere in the same posi\ntion that thev assume in those noc\nturnal dances, they would both be\nimmediately arrested and locked up\non a charge of public indecency.\nThe old time dance, when to start\nit. used to be. "Honor your partner,\njoin bands and circle to the left,"\nmight have been all rieht (at least\nthey were decent) but I cannot say\nso much for the new style of dancing\nIf there is not enough virtue in the\nreligion of our Lord and Savior Jesus\nChrist to stamp out forever all desire\nfor the modern dances, I do not know\ndefinitely, and can only conjecture,\nwhere this craze for dancing win ana\nmany of our young people, both single\nand married. But there is an under\ncurrent of dissatisfaction prevalent\nwhich will, in .the not-far-distant\nfuture. Dut a stop to this very com\nmon craze. An Instance at point in\ntbe following clipping from the Globe-\nDemocrat: "New York to-day was\nwashed by a terpsicboreon reform\nwave. Proprietors of 400 public dance\nhalls were warned by Mrs. ueorge\nW. Loft. Deputy Police Commission\ner. that they would be jailed unless\nthey put a stop to \'indecent, demoral\nizing dancine\'. "Cheek to\ncheek dancing and movements known\nas the scandle walk, the cradle rock,\ntbe Obic8go camel, the syncopating\nshimmy and chicken shakes are ter\nrible. They must cease."\nI hope I have not thrown a Btone\ninto a veritable hornet\'s nest, Be that\nas it may, I would rather attack what\nI believe to be morally wrong than to\nhave the good will and respect of any-\n-one. \' \' : \'. -\nWednesday night, John Berthold,\nmanager of Kroner\'s store in bis\nmarcb, was held up and robbed of\nsomething over 860, while on the\nBtreets, going home for the night.\nvember 21, just two weeks, before he\nsubmitted the budget, President Hard\ning said: , -\n"If Government aid is a fair term\nand I think it is to apply to authori\nzations aggregating (75,000,000 to\npromote good roads for market high\nways, it is equally fit to be applied to\nthe establishment and maintenance\nof American market highways on the\nsalted seaa."\nThe roads which the Government\nhelps the States to build remain -the\nproperty of the people and are a pub\nlic utility free to all on the same\nterms. The ship bonus bill contem\nplates private ownership and opera\ntion of the vessels built by the people\nand sold to individuals and corpora\ntions at a loss of $2,800,000,000 com\npared with their original cost, and in\naddition to this, an annual bestowal\nof $75,000,000 from the Federal Treas\nury for the enrichment of these pri\nvate Interests. \'\nUnless President Harding\' has\nchanged his mind within . two weeks\nhe is willing to vote $76,000,000 a year\ninto the coffers of powerful corpora\ntions in spite of the Government\'s\nfiscal difficulties but doubtfnl of the\npropriety or wisdom of investing an\nequal snm in good roads for the bene\nfit of the whole people.\nlost . tremendously . in influence ,, in\nWashington both in the Senate and\nat the White House. At home the\npoliticians will no longer yield un\nquestioning obedience to him. They\nwill all he cin nronmtlv searching the\nc, c . ,\nhorizon for the new party leader.\nNeither friend nor enemy coold\nhave wished Mr. Lodge to face a\ntroubled future with his hands wither\ned and "his voice enfeebled by the\nBay State\'s vote of "no confidence."\nFrom Goodland.\no o die csz3K28\nSurvey Shows Federal Taxes are Higher\nThan in 1919.\nRepublican claims that Federal taxa\ntion has decreased under tbe Harding\nadministration are challenged by the\nstatements of the National Industrial\nConference Board, representing a\nlarge number of American manufac\nturers. This organization contends\nthat instead of a reduction of taxes\nthere has been an increase compared\nwith 1919.\nIn the United States Federal taxes\nalone totaled $4,925,000,000 in 1919 and\nin 1921 reached a total of $4,430,000,\n000, which appeared to be a decrease\n11.2 per cent. The report of the con\nference contends, however, that in\nasmuch as the 1921 dollar had a pur\nchasing power of2d. per tsenfc less\nthan Uhe 1919 dollar. Federal taxes\nin 1921 were actually 15 per cent high\ner than in 1919.\nThe National Industrial Conference\nwas not concerned in this report with\npartisan politics, so it did not take\nthe trouble to point ouf that a Demo\ncratic administration was in power in\n1919. The Harding administration\ncame into control of the Government\nin 1921.\nWinter seems to have set in for\nsure. This morning tne grounu m\ncovered with ice,\nF. M.

The only\npossiouuy oi reducing miea, no bojo,\nlies in the direction of curtailing ex\npenditures derivable from this $1,\n000,000,000.\nThere is a suggestion, if not a rec\nommendation, in the President\'s mes\nsage, that the Federal Government\n\' should withdraw or abridge its grants\nto aid "in lines of research; improve\nmen t, and development" presumably\n\' such as educational work performed\nby the Department of Agriculture,\nthe construction of roads, vocational\ntrainins. etc. In this connection be\nsaid;\n"There Is question as to how far the\nGovernment should participate in\nthese extraneous activities, and I am\nfrank to say ; that an answer to the\nquestion as to whether we can , look\nforward to any further material re-\n" duction in the expenditures of the\nGovernment in future years depends\nlargrlv upon whether or not there\nwill be a curtailment or expansion of\nthese activities, which have already\nadded greatly to tbe annual drafts\nupon the Treasury of the United\nStates.\'"\nJn hie address to Cong tees on No-\nState\' Water Power Mainly in the Ozarks.\nHow generally is it known that\nMissouri, mainly in the Ozarks the\n\'new Switzerlond\' has unharnessed\nhydro electric or water power suf\nficient to operate ten thousand fac\ntories, light all of the "corn belt\'\ncities, with perhaps enough current\nleft to electrify all. the railway systems\nwithin the borders of the state? ,\nAfter a recent trip of a week into\nthe. wildest sections of the Ozark\ncountry where the greatest number\nof falls, rapids and mammoth spring\nare to be found, Governor Hyde was\nso profoundly impressed with the\npossibilities there that he made the\nassertion that the Missouri bill coun\ntry has more water power than is to\nbe found in all New England.\nHenry Ford, one of America\'s most\nalert captains of industry to our na\ntural resources, now has a force of\nengineers collecting data on the water\npower possibilities of the Ozarka with\na view of constructing immense hydro\nelectric plants there.\nRobert Clark Dies After Long illness.\n(Huntington, Ind., Press.)\nRobert E. Clark, sixty-one years\nold, died Sunday at 6:45 o\'clock at the\nresidence, 734 Kintz street, following\nan Illness of fifteen years, followed by\na serious illness of one week; He was\nemployed as yard switch engineer for\nthe Erie.
