Shepherd, United Press\nStaff Corespondent.)\nSALONIKI, Dec. 13. (By Mail.)-\'\nTwo huge baskets, filled with wicker-\ncover-d hot ilea of ChiantI wine, from\namong which peeped the white necks\nof champagne bottles, made up our\nsupply of traveling provisions when,\nour party of correspondents set out\nfor the Anglo-French front in Serbia.\nTrue, indeed, there was a small pack-\nage for each man boiled eggs, cold\nbeef with tiny paper packets of salt\nand pepper but these were sa small\nwe were able to carry them in our\npockets.\nThis was an Italian scheme of pro.\nvisions. We had left to two Italian\njournalists a newspaper man In Italy\nis always a journalist the task of\npurchasing our food supply. We didn\'t\nknow, as we pulled out of the station\non a rattly military train, that we were\ngoing forward to witness the begin\nning of an ally retreat. Before us was\nKrivolak, where1 the French had fougut\nso long and bo hard with their "seventy-fives,"\nand General Sarrail had told\nns that we should see Krivolak and\nthe fighting there.\nAt the British Front\nBefore us was the British front, made\nup of veterans who had gone through,\nthe hell\'s fire of the Dardanelles. Be\nfore us were all the thrilling things to\nsee that the war affords.\nWe got out of the train at a little)\nrailroad station on the shore of Lalca\nDorian and found ourselves in the\nmidst of British troops. I\'ve used the\nname of the lake, though before we\nstarted out we were told that we must\nnet mention the names of places in our\nstories. But nine days have changed\nall that. The Bulgarians have all these\nplaces now. It is no secret.\nAn English captain met us.\n"Have you automobiles for thesa\ncorrespondents?" asked our French\nlieutenant guide.\n"Not a "one," said the British cap\ntain, "unless they wait to ride on t.hi3\nload of hay." He pointed to a big auto\ntruck half loaded with bales of Britioli\nhay. Into the truck wc piled with hal\na dozen English Tommies giving uJ\nlifts. Just as. we started off \' they\ncried, "Marble Arch, Holburn Circus,\nBank, Elephant and Castle."\nIt was a cockney\'s way of saying,\n"Houston street only," or "West Farm\nexpress." 4\n, No Sign of Retreat.\nWe hadn\'t seen a sign of retreat.\nThe British captain got onto a fine\nhorse and rode along beside us. The\nroad skirted the lake a circle of water\nthree miles across and scores of odd\nly dressed Greeks and Serbians peas\nants got out of our way as we rolled\nalong tlirough mud, hugging our oblon?\nseats of hay. Everywhere were British\nplodilin through the mud, riding\nheavy ii night horses, sitting by road-\nside fires.\n"Great fish in this lake," said the\nBritish captain, riding up behind tho\nmotor truck. "Perch, country round\nhere famous for them. Having some for\ndinner louight in my mess."\n"These duck3 ought to be good,"\nsaid one of our party pointing to the\nreeds where thousands of birds floated.\n"Not ducks," he said. "Some sort o!\nblackbird. Don\'t know whether they\'re\ngood or not. Going to try some of them\nin our mess tonight, too." i\n"Good horse you\'ve got theve."\n"Polo pony. Splendid.

Fiften miles brought us to\nc stack of goods piled up alon? the\nroad. There were pyramids of filled\n:acks, rolls of baib wire and heaps\nof the countless things that help make\nwar. In tho center of this three-acre\nhodgepodge was a tent and our first\nglimpse of it showed that it was decor\nated mo6t elaborately with hol\'y, the\ni\'brintmas kind, with shiny leaves and\nhrislu red berries.\nThen for the first time we noticed\nthat all the rough country through\nwhich we had passed was covered w ith\nshort shrublike holly bushes. All\nthrough Southern Serbia, through\nMacedonia and eastward; clear to the\nDardanelles and Gallipot!, this holly\ngrows as common as the sage brush of\nfexas.

Wo might have\nknown then and there the tall young\nofficer who was talking to us about the\nsnow and the burst eggs and the cold\ncertainly did know that this move\nment of tho supplies to the rear meant\na retreat.

Ted figured it out after lunch\nuntil even Uncle Chris commented on\nbis abstraction at the office. Wbero-\nupon Ted sat up and took notice, for\nVncle Chris was absolute judge and\narbiter temporarily over bis actions.\nHe Heard from Signa Lawrence that\n\'Amy was back. Signa corresponded\nWith her regularly and was well aware\nthat Ted paid tar mora attention to\nbar comings and goings than he did to\nthe sun, moon and stars all put to\ngether. \'\n"She\'ll be here for at least a month.\nso you\'d better be making hay, Ted\ndy," Signa bad advised. Make hay\nwhen he only had a sure thing of\nIghteen per. He wanted a good\nwhacking salary now, big enough ao\nhe. could go to old J. C. Burnham and\ntell Jim be wanted to marry Amy and\ncould take Care of her.\nPeep in his own musings, Ted stared\nbefore him on his desk stool behind\none of the bank windows and failed to\nnotice Putney until be had spoken\ntwice. Putney, just at that minute,\nlooked to Ted\'s troubled vision like\nthe perfect pattern of the sort of\nman he wanted to be himself. Putney j\nwas a partner in the best automobile\nconcern In town.\n"Hello, Ted!" he called genially,\nlaying down his bank book, deposit\nBlip and a nice full pad of yellow\nbacks. "Just Blip those away for me,\nwill you ? Going to the Dorrance\ndance tonight?"\nMaybe he was, Ted said rather\ngloomily. , He wasn\'t Bure. Thrn all\nthe morning he meditated, finally de\nciding to take the plunge and go.\nWhen he went out to lunch, he took\nthe five he had decided to squander,\nwent over to the best florist\'s in town\nnd ordered the roees.\nAmy was slim and dark, with eyes\nif warmest, deepest brown and skin\nlike a jasmine flower. So he chose\nthe little, close, dark red "Jacks" for\nher, and had them sent with his card.\nAnd just as he watched them being\nplaced in the box he heard Putney\'s\nfolce behind him order orchids\ntwenty-five dollars\' worth of lavender\nsrehids.\nThat night he went to the Dor-\nrances\' dance. Polly Dorrance was\nSpecially nice So him, but he watched\nfor Amy. She would wear orchids,\nand he would want to die on the spot,\nyet some deadly spell held him. And\nall at onco he saw her. Put was\ndancing with her. ..Just as they passed\nwhere he sat with Polly she looked at\nhim and smiled.\n"Polly," he said hurriedly, "was she\nwearing red roses or orchids, did you\nsee?"\n"Jacks," said Polly, placidly.\n"WhyT"\nBut Ted had excused himself and\nwas moving away - in a dream. He\nfound himself inexplicably beaming\non people and getting ecstatically in\neverybody\'s way until be found her.\nPutney stood talking to her, and she\nasked htm to go and dance with poor\nPolly, left all alone.\n"You wore them." Ted said tinder\nhis breath. "Amy. you darling!"\n"Somebody\'ll hear you huah! Of\ncourse I wore them. I why. I\'m very\nfond of 3ack\' roses, you know."\n: "He sent you orchids."\n"They Were beautiful," she flushed\nsver so Bllghtly "but I like roses\nbest."\n: Ted drew her away from the hall\nroom. He knew the Dorrance house,\n.hue there was a window seat under\nthe big stained-glass window in the\nside hall, and he led her there out ol\nSight\n? "You know end I know," he told her\nin his funny, frank, boyish way, "that\nI\'m up against It with Uncle Chris\ni\'va got to make good or I don\'t get a\nSou out of him.
