She was caught\nwith the furs on and although she\nprotested thatshe was trying fhera', 'fen, evidence against her looked so 1\nstrong that when she was unable to\nget any one to give evidence of her\ngood character, Judge Mahoney\ngave her a six months\' sentence: -\nJudge Mahoney read the letter,,\nthought the matter over carefully\nana men aeciaea to sena a telegram\nto Gov. Dunne at Springfield, asking\nhim to free Mrs. Toogood, if only for\nChristmas. The governor is the only\nhope for the convicted woman and\nthe little child who waits.\nThe judge has forwarded a copy of\nlittle Esther\'s letter to the governor.\nIt reads:\n"Dear Sir: I am writing to let you\nknow that I miss my mother and I\nwant her to come home. I know my\nmother is not guilty of stealing those\nfurs.\n"My mother is not able to serve\nsix months in prison for her health\nis not good.

I would prefer\nto let Mrs. Toogood out even though"\nthe letter is a fake than to keep her\nin, if the little child is waiting for her\nmother to come home.\n"I would rather feel that somebody\ncheated the law than to feel that\nEsther waited through the long\nhours of Christmas for the footsteps\nthat never came:\n"But I am powerlesf.

Villa\'s\nforces attacked Torredn at 4 o\'clock\nthis morning and a battle for posses\nsion of the city was raging at day-\nbreak today. This information\nreached here by wire to Mexican\ngovernment officials.\nEarly yesterday Villistas captured\nZemijillo, about 30 miles north of\nTorreon, after the garrison had. fled\nto the latter city.\nTorreon is the railway key to\nNorthern Mexico, many lines con\nverging at that point.

A joint re\nsolution proposing a special hori\nzontal ad valorem tariff of ten per\ncent on all imports except salt, in\ncluding those already taxed and\nthose on the free list will be intro\nduced by Representative Garner,\nTexas, Democrat, immediately afteit\nthe holidays, .he .announced today', 'PRESIDENT\'S NOTE MEANS NEW POLICY\n-ENGLAND COLD TO PROPOSAL\nWashington, Dec. 22. Recovering\nslowly from the dizzy whirl of yester\nday\'s history-making developments,\ngovernment officials and foreign dip\nlomats here today looked to the for\neign offices of the belligerent nations\nfor the next peace move.\nIt appears the same surprise and,\nwonderment was occasioned in Eu\nrope by the president\'s overtures as\nwere manifest here when his move\nbecame known. This first wonder\nment over, the president believes the\nwarriors will feel far more inclined\nat least seriously and carefully to\nconsider his suggestions.\nOfficials and diplomats, after\nstudying Sec\'y Lansing\'s two an\nnouncements yesterday one quali\nfying the other so as to practically\ndiscount some of its apparent mean\ning have reached the following con\nclusions: President Wilson has made his first\nsfep in a more, vigorous course de\ntermined upon to\' maintain American\nrights during the war:\nHe has warned both sides that in\nevent of any herculean and final des\nperate efforts to win should present\npeace overtures collapse America\nmust not be made to suffer.\nThe move was prompted primarily\nto bring peace before further blows\nmay be\'struck at the structure of in\nternational law.\nIt was made not only in the in\nterests of the United States, but was\ninfluenced by the appeals from all\nneutrals to this country for some\nstrong positive stand.\nThe United States government is\ndetermined to remain out of the war\nif possible, but warns of the danger\nof unrestricted activities by belli\ngerents should the strife continue.\nSo far as its attitude on neutrality\nis concerned, President Wilson has\nnot changed. \'\n, He has no switched trom bis\nstrong conviction that the country\ndoes not want war if peace can be\nmaintained with honor. \'\nHe will use every human means\npossible to keep the country aloof\nfrom the struggle. .\nFor the same reasons that Great\nBritain and her allies did not flatly\nreject the peace proposals of the Teu\ntonio powers, they will not flatly turn\ndown the suggestions made by Pres\nident Wilson in his "peace mes\nsages," was the expressed belief of\nsome entente diplomats here today.\nWashington, Dec. 22. Congress\nwill let the president have free hand\nin his attempt to find a common\nground upon which European belli\ngerents can meet .to formulate plans\nfor a lasting peace. Both houses re\nfused to endorse or take any action\non the president\'s note.\nLondon, Dec. 22. The govern\nment\'s wisdom in allowing President\nWilson\'s note to "soak" 24 hours was\napparent today. It saved a torrent\nof violent denunciation of America.\nToday, although the British press\nwas practically unanimous in deplor\ning President Wilson\'s intervention,\nthe comments ranging from pained\nsurprise to bitter resentment, there\nwasn\'t such sweepingly violent de\nnunciation as there would have been\nif the first impressions had been al\nlowed full play.\nAtrthat there were plenty of vigor\nour expressions showing that the\nBritish nation is in no mood to meet\nGermany except on the allies\' own\nterms, which have already been out\nlined sufficiently for Germany to ac\ncept or decline.\nFew question the motives or the\nspirit which impelled the note, but\nmost of th$ editorials point out that\nit was unhappily conceived and tact\nlessly worded especially in its refer\nences to "small nations." This, it\nwas contended, conveyed the impres\nsion tfmt the allies were equally;', 'guilty with the central powers in this\nrespect n.\nThe attitude of the British govern\nment on President Wilson s peace\nnote cannot be defined until after\nEngland has consulted "with her\nallies, Chancellor of the Exchequer\nBonar Law announced in the house\nof commons today.

Germany\nwill disclose her chief peace terms\nimmediately if the forthcoming note\nfrom the entente powers, in reply to\nBethmann-Hollweg\'s peace pro\nposals, leaves the peace door openJ\nGerman dispatches said it was semi\nofficially announced today.\no o\nTRIBUNE LOSES IN LIBEL SUIT\nRAKED WOMAN\'S PAST MUR\nDER MYSTERY\'FIGURES\nFred H. Menhard of Louisville, Ky.,\nand his wife Lucille McLeod Men-\nhard, formerly of Chicago, today\nwalked out of Judge Slosser\'s court\nas winners of a libel suit" against the\nChicago Tribune.\nFour straight days this .week the\nTribune\'s lawyers put on witnesses\naimed to prove Mrs. Menhard a bad\nwoman, a wicked woman, a daughter\nof the redlights, a vampire and a\nmurderess.\n. In the center of the Tribune\'s ter\nritory, where it swings a newspaper\nclub of wide and brutal power, the\ntwo strangers from . Kentucky were\nable, to beat the Tribune, prove it a\nfalsifier and show that in Cook\ncounty it\'s not exactly true that it\'s\nharder to convict a newspaper than\na woman of a crime.\nThe story? One day eleven years\nago Lucille McLeod was found in a\nroom in the old Empire hotel on Wa\nbash avenue with a jagged wound\nof a buljet torn through her left\'\nbreast and seventh rib. She was j\ntaken to hospital. In the hotel room\nwith her was a man, Wm. T. Nie\nman, president of the Nieman Table\nCo., a furniture, manufacturer with\nmuch money. He had a bullet\nthrough the head, was \'taken to the\ncounty morgue and later buried.\nAmong unsolved murder mysteries\nof Cook county is this one of who\nshot Nieman. Lucille McLoed was"\ntried on charge of murder in De\ncember, 1906. She was acquitted.\nShe met Fred Menhard. He\'s a\ntraveling salesman for Libby, McNeil\n& Co. They were married. Nearly\nten years now they have been happy\nlucky couple and the going seems to\nbe good for, them. All the time life\nwas getting sunnier for them and the\nold shadows of the early and reck\nless daysf of Lucille McLeod were\nnever talked about. .\nA boy was born to them. He\nstands higher than his mother\'s knee\nand is learning to talk. His father\nand mother were getting proud of\nthe way he could say the family\nname.\nThen came the Chicago Tribune\'\nand spattered a smear of blood and\nshame across the family name. On\nMarch 6 this year the Tribune re\nferred to a will left by a distant rel\native of Lucille McLeod Menhard and v\nmade the statement that she "shot-\nand killed Nieman" in 1905 ahd was\n"repudiated by her relatives."\nThese allegations were attacked ,\nby Mrs. Menhard in libel action. The\njury returned a verdict of $1 dam\nages today after four hours\' deliber\nation. On the first ballot a major\nity were in favor of assessing the\nTribune $10,000, according to stor\nries from the jury room.\noo\nLincoln,\' Neb.

FIND NEW GAME\nTO INFLICT HARDSHIPS ON SHOP GIRLS\nConditions of the old dark days\nstill exist in the State street depart\nment stores in the treatment of the\nemployes by the millionaire owners.\nThis year, however, afraid of State\nFactory Oscar F. Nelson, the bosses\nhave woTked out a, cunning plan to\nremain within the ten-hour law for\nwomen workers..\nNelson has taken personal charge\nof- the investigation of the State\nstreet stores which begun about a\nweek ago. So far no actual viola\ntions of the law have been discovered.\nBut a stunning game that produces\njust as much hardship to the girls\nhas been uncovered.\nThe latest scheme tried out by the\nmerchant princes to extract the max\nimum amount of work from the, girls\nis the split-time system, that has\nbeen tried by sweatshop owners.\nThe Fair, Hillman\'s and the Boston\nStore (the latter owned by Mollie\nNetcher Neuberger, who was a shop\ngirl once herself) seem to be the\nhardest in their treatment of their\ngirl employes. But ,all of them, re\nmembering Inspector Nelson of old,\nare careful to observe the law.\nAt Hillman\'s the cashiers have to\nbe in the store at 8:15 a. m., to be\nready for work at 8:30. At 12:30\np. m. they are relieved. At 6 p. m.\nthey return and work until long\nafter the store closes, the customers\nare all. out and the stock is "taken\ncare of.\nMost of the girls live miles from\nthe store. Nelson pointed out to\n\' Manager Hitt that these girls had to\nget up about 6 a. m. in order to dress,\n- eat breakfast and be at the store by\n8:15. (It will be remembered that\ndepartment store employes who are\n\' late are fined.)\nAfter 12:30 they must eat lunch.\nThey hardly have sufficient time to\ngo home and rest after that.x Nelson\npointed out to Hitt that they must\npercentage of their day\'s salary for\namusement and become subject to\nthe insults of flirts by loafing either\nin the stores or in "movie" theaters.\nWhatever they do to pass away the\ntime in the loop they can get no rest.\nThe Fair and the Boston Store try\nthe same stunt Some of the girls\nstart to work at 11 a. m. and are\nthrough at 11 p. m. But to get dawn\nto the 10-hour law they are given two\n45-minute meal periods and two 15\nminute periods for rest\nNelson received complaints from\nseveral girls that they are not able\nto get out of the store until 11:30\np. m. because of the inadequately\nsmall cloak rooms. The stores give\nthe girls as little room as possible for\ntheir clothes. They are forced to\n1 form in lines when they go for their\ncoats. By the time the end of the\nlines are reached it is close to mid\nnight. "But they are through work\nat lo\'tfock," the store bosses argue.\nSo the law is unable to reach the\nowners.\nA score of women\'s clubs, led by\nthe Chicago Woman\'s club, the Con\nsumers\' league and the Woman\'s City\nclub, are making a fight for more\nstools for the girls. The S.tate St\nMerchants\' ass\'n is opposing them.\nThe department store bosses ar\ngue that .they lose business if, the\ngirls are allowed to sit down during\nworking hours. They say customers\nwon\'t buy from a girl sitting down;\nthat she gives the impression of not\n"caring to be disturbed."\nAfter the holidays the women plan\nan educational compaign to get the\npeople of Chicago interested in the\nneed for stools for the girls who are\nnow forced to stand up al day.\no o\nNew York.

Mayor Thompson will\n\'seek revenge on State\'s Att\'y Hoyne.\nIn both of these moves he has been\nassured of the support of "Maje" Mc\nCormiek, boss of the Chicago Tri\nbune, and a certain element of pro\nfessional reformers.\nThis Isn\'t wild conjecture. It\'s the\ndope that\'s passed men in the \'City\nHall who have been given an inkling\nof the schemes of the Trib politician\neditor and Big Bill Thompson. The\nman framing the deal is Charley\nWheeler, McCormick\'s political\nagent, who holds secret jconference\nalmost daily with the mayor and\nSammy Bttelson, who seems to be\nrapidly becoming Big Bill\'s chief adviser.\nAt one of these conferences the\nplan to watch Hoyne\'s handling of\nSunday saloon violations was\nevolved, it has been agreed to\npinch all saloonkeepers without suf\nficient "drag," thereby passing the\nbuck to the prosecutor.\nFollowing this conference the\nCity Hall crowd stuck city-paid ste\nnographers in the courtrooms where\nthe cases were set to gather material\nfor the forthcoming attack on\nHoyne. Judge La Buy ordered one of\nthe stenographers from his court\nafter Ass\'t State\'s Att\'y Qulrke ob\njected. Then Sammy Ettelson, Big Bill\nand Harry Miller decided to ask\nJudge Olson, chief justice of the mu\nnicipal court, to order his associate\njudges not to disturb the Thompson\nLundin stenographers.\nIt Is-expected Judge Olson will is\nsue the desired order. His feud tyith\nHoyne is well known to Chlcagoans.\nIn addition, the Trib favors such an\norder, and Olson has shown a dis\nposition to try to please the Trib\nwhenever possible.\nIf the City Hall crowd can get any-\n, thing at fcll on Hoyne, Sammy Et\ntelson and other legal lights of the\nLundin bunch will ask for a special\ngrand jury and the indictment of\nHoyne on a charge of malfeasance in\noffice charge. The Trib will boost\nthe game along by the desired favor\nable publicity.\nIt is a. nice, neat game if it pans\nout Thompson will try to keep the\npolitical reason qu!e,t by playing the\n"dry". end and shouting that be is\ndoing-Jto to suppress "unlawful sa\nloons." Maje McCormick who got\nhis fingers burned when he .tried to\nhandle Hoyne, will get his chance\nfor revenge and. he reformers will\nall rally around Big Bin.

Will\n.sensed this; when Julietta set her\nmind on anything, wild horses would\npnot drag her away from it. But .the\ncontingency had never occurred and\n-the baby occupied all Julietta s life.\nWill adored Doris, too. She was a\nitiny thing, 3 years old, with flaxen\n. hair, blue eyes and a gay laugh that\nrwent right to her parents\' hearts.\ntWill counted the hours spent in the\nlighthouse until he could return to\nj her.\n; Twice a day, at dawn and in the\n\' safternoon, he rowed across from the\nr mainland to the light, -where he pol\nished his mirrors and filled the oil\n-tank. .There was other work to be\ntdone besides, and it was often late\nbefore Will returned him.\n- They often woridered what they\nwould do if ever Doris fell sick. She\n\'-had been a healthy baby, but one\nr could never know and the nearest\ndoctor was 20 miles away, and not\ntoo apt to come to the call of poor\n.folk.\nt That contingency actually came to\n.pass.

Of course Julie\nwas temporarily distraught\nBut when he reached the light\nhouse he found that something had\ngone wrong with the apparatus\nwhich supplied the oil vapor through\nthe feed pipe. The tiny channel was\ni clogged, and the whole mechanism\nhad to be taken to pieces and\ncleaned. It was heart-breaking\nwork; It would take him all night,\nand there was need of haste at that,\nbefore the reservoir at the iop gave\noqt and let out the flame.\nDoggedly he started upon his task.\nAnd the hours rolled by, while he\nworked, black with oil and grease,\nand overhead the great shaft of\nflame gave out its revolving message\nof hope to the world.\nHe had finished at last, and he was\nlooking out Into the gray- of the\nmorning. He had mended the appa--tatus\nand the oil ihad lasted. Now\nhe could puf out the light, refill and\nhasten homeward.\nBut during the night a strange\nchange had taken place in the man.\nJulie\'s menace had assumed porten\ntous shape in his mind. And in imag\nination he saw the child dead and\nthe \'body lying in its little cradle In\ntheir wrecked home.\nShe should not drive him away! He\nwould go back for Doris\' sake and\nstay. He would fight down her\nwrath all his life long, if necessary,\nbut he would stay.\nHe took his boat and pulled across\nthe channel. Would he arrive in time\nto see the baby alive? What had hap\npened during that night of suffering?\nHe \'grounded it on the beach and\nbegan running wildly up the slope.\nThere stood his cottage, trim and\nneat as if death were not a visitor\ninside. He pushed open the door.\nHis wife sat beside the cradle, her\nhead against the edge. He thought\nthat she. was dead, so still she\nseemed. But at his step she raised\nher head and opened her eyes.\n3The haggard eyes of the man trav\neled from Julletta\'s worn face to the\nstill body inside the cradle. A hoarse\nery broke from bis hps.

Now, fellow watch\nmakers, do you approve of such con\nditions? You don\'t have to be a\nrebel to say no. It is a shame and\ndisgrace to our trade.\nWe who require so much skill to\nbe good mechanics should not have\nto stand for such shameful condi\ntions. We could also cite you many\nmore horrible conditions that are ex\nisting in our trade, but space does\nnot allow us.

I\nshould judge so, from Mr. Cochran\'s\nrecent editoriaL\nIt is very peculiar how the new Is\nsues arising out of the European war\nare dividing our people. Take this\nquestion of compulsory military\ntraining, for instance. i\n. Who are in favor of it? Big busi\niess as a whole, most emphatically,\nand as might be expected, from\nbusiness motives. Imagine the con\ntracts necessary to insure five or ten\nmillion citizen soldiers the essential\nmilitary equipment uniforms, guns,\nshoes, swords, machine guns, etc.\nRich; juicy pickings. I presume this\ngroup wpuldjose all its patriotic ar\ndor fortius movement were the gov\nernment itself to manufacture all the\nsupplies needed. Of \'course, they\nwant compulsory military service,\nbelieving that they will be able to\ncontroL such a body. They .think.', 'most qf the officers -will be chosen\nfrom their class, and, -with the con\ntrol of government and a centralized\nmilitary system, they reason their\nposition as the dominant group will\nbe strengthened.\nOpposed to them in the object\nthey hope to achieve, but united in\ntheir advocacy of this movement, is\na group of radicals, prominent\namong whom are Charles Edward\nRussell and Victor Berger, both lead\ning Socialists, who on this issue are\nat variance with tieir party major\nity. They believe that this phase, of\nmilitarism is as natural a product\nunder the present industrial system\nand as foolish to try to prevent as\nthe formation of the trusts. Fur\nthermore, this country, they argue,\nis worth defending in the sense that\nwe want to solve our own problems\nrather than endure any benevolent\nattempt of others to reform us by\nforce. Therefore, since compulsory\nmilitary training is bound to be in\ntroduced, they say we should heed\nthe movement and see that it is\nmade a democratic movement and\nused only as a measure of self-defense\nagaiast alien foes.\nAlive to the danger of its being\nused as another weapon to hold\ndown the people, these leaders hope\nby actively participating in its or\nganization to make it even an even\ntual agency in securing control of\nthe government for the masses.\nThey argue that the greatest tyr\nanny occurs when the ruling class,\nwith military power at its back, con\nfronts a people unused to weapons\nand ignorant of their powers of re\nsistance. Here is a live issue, the discussion\nof which it seems to me would be\nmore enlightening to the readers of\nThe Day Book than- the endless sex\narticles by our good friend, Allen\nSteven. Would suggest Allen divert\nhis mind and give us a little illumina\ntion on this subject. We must take\na direct stand either for or against\nJhe increased extension of our sys\ntem of military preparedness. What\nshall that attitude be, and, if re\nsolved in of such measures as com\npulsory military training, how far"\nshall it go? If the young men of the\nworking classes are to be the cannon\nfodder shall we lay the burden of its\ncost upon the wealthy classes? Shall\nwe draft wealth along with body ser\nvice? James H.

Although these chick\nens are npt prizewinners, they are\nfair, and I will leave it to the readers\nif they are worth while.\nBeginning Feb. 1, 1916, to date, I\nhave received 1.-607 eggs; also we\nhave eaten 39 pounds of spring\nchicken, and still have some left The\ninvestment is about $12 to $15. My\nexpenses have been $30.43, and I\nfigure that eggs cost me 17 cents a\ndozen, plus the trouble (I call- it a\nhobby), and I know I have gotten\nreal fresh eggs, not cold storage stuff,\nwhich is some satisfaction.\nNow,- I have made some expert-.\nments\' and find that ten hens, well\nkept, will supply an average family\nwith eggs at the cost of table scraps\nand a pound -and a quarter of mixed\ngrain feed.

Evi\ndently there has been an opening of\neyes in he editorial sanctum of "The\nMasonic Chronicler." Late In 1915 it\neditorially jumped on the Chicago\nTeachers\' Federation as a tool of the\nCatholic church, and said: "The\nmembers of the Roman .Catholic\n\' church, through the Teachers\' Fed\neration and the politicians, virtually\nhave ruled the bo"ard.\nAt that time the loyal organ of\nMasonry evidently believed what it\nsaid. Since that time ,Ella Flagg\nYoung has been ousted and Snoop,\nthe Masonic candidate, has been\nmade superintendent of schools\nJake Loeb has supplanted M. J. Col\nlins as. president of the board, and\nis- the real doss of the schools.\nBacked by much of the Protestant\nelement that elected Thompson\nmayor, Boss Loeb has fired 68 school\nteachers, including officers of the\nTeachers\' Federation, and is pushing\nhis war on iixt organization of\nteachers. By no stretch of the imag\nination can "The Masonic Chron\nicler" now claim that the Federation\n- controls the board.\nYet in its issue of Dec. 16, 1916,\n"The Masonic Chronicler" says; "In\nthe opinion of The Chronicler it is\nuseless to expect any relief from the\npresent -board of education or any\nboard that may be appointed by the\npresent mayor. He has betrayed\' the\ntrust reposed in him. tie has shown\nhimself to be weak and, incompetent,\nnot only in regard to selecting school\ntrustees, but in every way. The city\nwas never in such incompetent\nbands."\nBesides, the local organ of Mason\nry jumps on the Tribune and News\nas beneficiaries of the midnight lease\nand is not surprised that these two\norgans favor the appointive system\nfor school trustees. "Wis safe to\nsay," says The Masonic Chronicler,\n\' "that had th trustees been ejected j\nduring the last 20 years- the Tri\nbune\'s midnight lease could not have\nbeen consummated. That publica\ntion leased one of the most valuable .\npieces of school property in Chicago\nfor one-half the rental value, one of\nthe made-to-order school boards ar\nranging the deal in the night"\nI\'m glad The Masonic Chronicler\nhas its eyes open at last. The Teach- .\nera\' Federation earned the everlast\ning enmity of the Tribune by expos- \'\nJng that midnight lease and by trying \'\nto force the Tribune to give back to\nthe schools of Chicago the money it\nhas taken from them. -Of course that\nisn\'t the reason given publicly for the 1\nLoeb fight on the Federation. Nor is\nit the secret reason passed -put all\nover Chicago. The charge that the .\nCatholic church controlled the Fed-\neration was a mere subterfuge by ,\nBig Biz to stir up Protestant voters\nto help get Jake Loeb in control of\nthe school board. In fact Loeb tried\nto make peace with the Federation.\nAnd now he is backed by both the\nTribune and News, and the Trib is .\nmakings strong play througE Char- ,\nlie Wheeler to preside over the\nkitchen cabinet of the inayor. What\ndoes the Trib want? What\'s its\nprice? Does it want to hand pick\nthe new members of the school\nboard? Has the lease anything to\ndo with it? Why is the Trib op- .\nposed to a school board of seven\nelected by the people? Why does" it .\nprefer school trustees appointed by\nthe mayor? Why is it back of Loeb?\nWhat\'s up, anyhow?\noo\nMUST CUT CITY\'S EXPENSE6\nA 13.76 per cent reduction of ex\npenditures in all city departments\nwas ordered yesterday by the finance\ncommittee, when it -was figured that\nthe city will face a revenue shortage\nof about $4,000,000 next year.\nIn the police department this will\nmean that 700 men will have to be\nlaid off or each member of the de\npartment must take a six weeks\' m-cation.', 'CONFESSIONS OF A WIFE\nLIFE REALLY IS\nI did not sleep very well last night,\nlittle book, and this morning I\ndressed and went out a little before\n4 o\'clock.\nIt seemed there was no one in the\nwhole world of sunshine and shim\nmering seat but the old man who was\ngoing along the board walk picking\nup papers with a tack on the end of\na stick.\nHe was very old, at least he looked\nolder than any other man I had ever\nseen. He was evidently very poor\nand yet he was humming some little\nold-fashioned tunes as I passed Mm.\n"Ain\'t you out rather early?" he\nquestioned -with a smile as I said\n"Good morning."\n"I could hot sleep," I answered, "so\nI thought I\'d get out and see the sun\nrise over the sea."\nAs I spoke the\' glorious kaleido\nscope of the sky above the horizon\nwas turning from crimson to gold.\nAs we the old man and I stood\nthere looking at it, he took off his\nhat and bowed.\n"It is the land of promise," he\nwhispered almost to himself. "Do\nyou know, young lady," he said,\nturning to me, "I have watched that\nwonderful sight almost daily for over\n60 years, right here from this Atlan\ntic City boardwalk, and no matter\nwhether I have shivered in the cold\nof December or been warmed by the\nbalmy August breezes, that sight has\ngladdened my eyes."\n"It is more beautiful than the sun\nset!" I exclaimed in surprise.\n"Yes," he answered, "because it\ntells of life to come. \'I promise day5\nit says, while the sunset is the end\nthe requiem of the dying day\n\'good-byV\' N\n"But," I could not help remon\nstrating, \'the morning sun does not\nalways fulfill its promise.

It is saying, "The day I am\n, bringing you will be filled with the\nWORTH LIVING\ngold of sunshine,\' and and yet before\nthe day is over we may have a\ndreary, drizzling rain."\nAs the old "man came nearer, he\nstopped almost unconsciously to\npoke a fragment of paper down a\ncrack between the boards of the\nocean and sand scrubbed walk.\n"My dear young lady," he said as\nhe raised his dim old \'watering eyes\nand peered kindly into my face, "you\nthink there is greater promise in the\nsky than there really is because you\nwant so much. All those splendid\nstreaks of orange and scarlet and\ngold promise are day, and if you live\nto be as old as I am you will find that\nis enough.\n. "When I was your age I, too, want\ned things wonderful things and I\nread into every .day the promise of\nthem and railed against fate as a liar\nwhen I did not get them. But now,\nalmost at the end of the journey, I\nknow nothing was every really prom\nised me except one day at a time.\nJust as that great golden disk over\nthere is again promising another\nday and a day only I can make of\nit what I will." ,\nHe stood silent for a minute, with\nhis face toward the eastern sky.\n"Tell me, I asked, "you who have\nlived long and who seem to be alone\nhere at last, is it worth living? Would\nyou like to go over the way again?"\nHis trembling old lips smoothed\ninto a smile as he answered: "Only\nyouth asks that question, and here\nlet me tell you that almost always"\nage Des when it answers.\n"Young woman, as" you see, I am\nold, poor and alone. All the compan\nions of my youth, all whom I ioved,\nhave gone before me beyond that\nlast crimson rim over there. But\nevery morning when I come out here\nalone and the sky sings, \'Another\nday is coming,\' and the sea echoes,\n\'Another day is coming,\' and the sun\nproclaims, \'Another day is here,\' I am', 'glad I am alive. I have known great\nsorrow, but I have had the wonder\nful compensation of joy unspeak\nable." Impulsively I held out my hand to\nthe old mam He took it in his\ngnarled misshapen one and looked\'\nat me with a tremulous smile. "Re\nmember," he said, "just to live even\nwhen you must suffer is glorious-, and\nwhen any old person tells you he\nwould not go back and live it over\nagain, he is either lying to you or to\nhimself."\nA step sounded loud in the morn\ning stillness.
