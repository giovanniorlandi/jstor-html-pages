NO.36. yVC\nTit Man Liars Abriii.\nGreensboro News.\nThere is a stupendous amount\no! vocal lying incidental to this\nwar It does not get much into\nprntt. A givat deal of it is un\ndoubtedly pathological lying, in\nnocent lying; there are people\neverywhere who a re constitution\nally unable to get things straight\n\'But more of it is careless, irre\nsponsible, repetion, without a\nthought of malice or harm. It\nis the sort of criminal careless\nness, in the repetition of what\none hears, from which all com\nmunities suffer, more or less, in\ntime of peace. There is no\nthought of malice, or treason in\nits circulation. There is suppos\ned to be a great deal of insiduous\nenemy propaganda deliberately\nwhispered about, and perhaps\nthere is. All this sort of thing\nserves the purpose of the Prus\nsian adversary, and there will\nnever be any way of knowing\nhow much of it is due to actual\nagents of Prussianism, and . how\nmuch to the carelessness of peo\nple who consider themselves loy\nal, and who are merely following\na confirmed - habit, parroting\nWhatever they hear, that is of a\nnature unusual enougti to create\nan impression.\nIt would be a fine tbingif very\nperson who makes a statement\no! what may be called "sensation\nal" nature, declaring what pur\nports to be some curious fact\nconnected with the war, could be\nasked to give authority for the\nstatement, and it the statement\ncould be run down systematical\nly and its truth or falsity estab\nlfohed. Eventually men would\ncome to reflect upon the undesir\nable consequences of repetition\nfor which competent" authority\nconld not be produced.\nThe mere utterer of patent dis\nloy a1ti s, of bar1 Jy ssditious some\ntimes, is not going to do much\nharm thereby. In the average\ncommunity he runs a risk of be\ning roughly bandied, lie ought\nto be rebuked, of course, for sev\neral reasons. It ought to be\nclone so that it would be realized\nthat this sort of thing cannot be\ndone and got away with; and he\nought to be placed in the hands\nof the proper authorities in or\nder to check any tendency to mob\nviolencewhich of. all ihings is\nthe very thing this country does\nnot at this time need. Between\na mere vapi 1 fool uttering ba\nt edof hu government and its\npurpose, and a mob of tools en\ngaged in exposing contempt\nfor that government by lynch\ning somebody there is hardly\nany comparison, on account of\nthe injury they do the govern\n\' ment.\n. Forgot What He Needed.\nFrom the Republican, Mt Gi\nia I, Ohio. The editor bad an in\nteresting experience some time\nago, when a young gentleman\nedine to this office and asked for\na copy of the Morrow County Re\nDublican. lie scrutinized it care\nfully when a copy was handed\nhim, an I then said: \'Now Ik.iow.\'\nWhat is it you are looking for,"\nwe enquired. "My wife sent me\nafter a bottle of OiambTlain\'s\nCough Remedy, and I forgot the\nname. I went to several stores\nand the clerfcs named evt-rything\nin the line on the shelf except\n\'chamberlain\'s. I\'ll try again,\nan 1 I\'ll nerervo home without\nChamberlain\'s Cough Remedy."\nThe. Republican would suggest\nto the proprietors of stores that\nt\'lev post their clerks, and never\nlet them substitute. Customers\nlose laith in stoees where substi\ntuting is permitted,\' to sap notb\ning of the io justice to makers of\ngood goods apd the disappoint\nment of customers. Adv.\nChildren dry\nFOR FLETCHER\'S\'\n-ASTORIA\n" Knr Pstato Flcar is Madt\nThe pioneer marketer of the\nold Oregon trail, Ezra Meeker, is\nnot satisfied with the laurels he\nobtained in the earlier days and\nhe is now again serving hiecouu\ntry by pioneering in the manu\nfacture of potato flour.\nPotato flour is not a new pro\nduct to Mr. Meeker for he manu\nfactured this product for the Al\naska trade y ars ago. Mr. Meek\ner receutly stated that a plant\nfor handling potatoes can be eas\nily constructed for a few hundred\ndollars from material obtainable\nanywhere in his section, which is\nin the extreme northwest.\n"A ton pf potatoes," says Mr.\nMeeker "will produce 500 pounds\nof flour." The process be de\nscribes is simple and inexpensive.\nFirst the potatoes are washed\nclean and then sliced with the\npeelings on and dropped innie\ndiately into clean water to pre\nvent discoloration and to rinse\nthem; then as soon as practica\nble they are either parboiled or\nsteamed from 8 to 10 minutes\nI ng enough to cook the starch\nparent. Ttie cooked slices are\nthen transferred to a drier and\nfor the first few hours subjected\nto a current of hot air not great\ner than 120 degrees F., after\nwhich the temperature is grad\nually increased to 170 degreep,\nbut no greater.\nThe drying process is contin-\nued until the slices are brittle,\nthough it is immaterial if a few\nhere and there are not thorough\nly dried. When taken on the\nkiln, the dried product is placed\nin a compact pile in dry room\nand handled over \'daily for three\nor four days until the pile "evens\nup," after jvhich they are ready\nfor the mill to grind tbetn into\npotato meal or flour. A revolv-\ning washer a long box partially\nemerged in a tank of water can\nbe cheaply built to easily wah a\nton of potatoes in an hour. An\nordinary root cutter costing $30\nor less, will answer to slice the\npotatoes, but is likely that a\nmore desirable machine for slic\ning may be found on the market.\nThe average mill will cost from\n150 to $225 and up, but at\npresent cannot be obtained on\ns\'lort notice.\nMr. Meeker mentions one po\ntato flour plant at Yakina,\nWash., that is producing 25 to\n30 barrels of flour a day. In Ap\nril this flour whs selling at $21 a\nbariel.\nRev. N.

"Food Will Win the .War?\nwheat is the teeL\nUnci Bam.-\nTHE SLACKER\nThroughout North Carolina and the nation sentiment\n. toward the slacker is crystalizing and the fine finger of\necorn and contempt is searching him out.\nThere are several varieties of slackers. Here are some\nof them:\nThe service slacker the man who should be in the\nranks and is not. .\nThe labor slacker the man who is able to work and\n, doesn\'t.\nThe food slacker the male or female hog who refuses\nto readjust their diet so as to meet the demands of our\nAllies for those foodstuffs which may be exported.\nThe financial slacker the individual who can but does\nnot buy Liberty bonds and War Savings Stamps.\nSlacking at home means more blood spilled by true blue\nAmerican boys in France.\nSlacking in America means starvation for innocent\nwomen and children in England, France and Italy.\nSlacking at home is a menace to the success of the\nAmerican, British and French arms in France.\nTHE SLACKER\'S REWARD\n, The intelligent, observant, patriotic people of America\nwill not forgive slacking.\nThe slacker is a marked man. Not only during the\nwar, but as the war goes on and the casualty lists come\nin he will be more and more scorned and hated by decent\ncitkens.\nAfter the war is over he will be an object of contempt.\nHe will be without the regard of decent people in his\ncommunity. His children and his children\'s children\nafter him will pay a bitter price for his disloyalty For\n. his failure under test to do his duty by his country and by\nhumanity.\nInexorable fate is setting him apart and he will not\nescape,\nMany St-istitutes Are\nDisplayed at the Leipzig Fair\nAccording to the Leipzig cor-\nresoondent of a Christiana news\npaper, the Leipzig spring fair\nshowed exhibits of many Yubsti-\ntutes and surrogates which have\nbeen placed on the market in\nGermany. Descriptions of some\nof these have been received by\nthe United States Chamber of\nCommerce:\nA surrogate for pepper is offer\ned for sale, which, judged by the\nappearance, seems almost like\nreal pepper. The color, odor,\nand taste have been surprisingly\nwell imitated,\nA tea is shown to which the\nname of "(lerman tea" has been\ngiven, it is prepared Irom any\none or a combination ot a great\nvariety of plants, from Btrawber-\nry leaves to linden bloseoms. It\nis 6aid to taste very much like\ngenuine tea, but even a half doz\nen cups will not produce the\nstimulation caused by a single\ncup of reul tea.\nThere are any number of sur\nrogates for marmalades. Most\nof them arepiepared from gar\nden vegetables instead of from\nfruits, with a minimum amount\nof sugar.\nSubstitute soap is offered for\ni-al", which is said to have been\nprepared from the oil in berries\nand from pumice stone. It lacks,\nhowever, the onemaincharacter\nistic of soap, that of working up\ninto a rich, creamy lather; other\nwise it is very good. Substitu\ntes are also to be bad for laun\ndry blueing.\nSubstitute bicycle tires are\nsometimes made of two coocen\ntric iron rings w ith small springs\nbetween them. They are very\nserviceable on asphalt pavements\nbut are not exactly as noiseless\nnor as easy riding as genuine\nrubber tires.\nA large number of articles off\nered for sale had been prepared\nlargely or entirely from paper\ncoarse working clothes for men\nand women, bloiues, aprons and\nother fabrics, There were paper\nbelts which seemed capable of\ndriving heavy loads.\nMany artificial and substitute\nleathers were noticed. Brass\nand copper articles were not seen\nf Every Bushel Saved Now Will\nSupply a Soldier with Bread\nUntil Next Harvest.\nLetter From Camp Sevier.\nMr. Editor. Just a few words\nto let you know that much to\nmy regret I hav been rejected\nfor oversea service. The old JJOtb\nDivision is now in France and\nmost of the 81st is here from\nCamp Jackson. I am to see the\neager, stalwart soldiers here\nwaiting for the call to join their\ncomrades on theiriug line of n\ncountry who rendered ussomuch\nassistance in the great struggle\nof years gone by.\nf will again appeal to the peo\nple to do everything possible for"\nthe preservation of the lives of\nthe loved ones who are gone. It\nthere was ever a time in the his\ntory of the world when tlie peo\nple should stand for liberty and\nright it is today. If there has\never beeu a small spark of pat\nriot ism existing in\' your lives\nthat now seems cold, you thon!d\ncultivate it, nnd do your duty\ntoward your country and your\nfellow men. Hemember that this\nis a time of war and not of peaie\nand we should be willing to sac\nritice everything in order to win\nthis war as soon as possible.\nwill agahi usk the boys of my\nold home countv not to be slack\ners but \'to be men, and go into\nthe service with a resolution to\naccomplish that which we roust\naccomplish before it is over,ovr\'\nthere.\nWith best wishes to all.\nW. C. GREENE.\nCamp Sevier, S. C.\nAccording to a statement by\nthe Department of Agriculture,\nthere has been an actual short\nage of more than 2,000,000 tons\nof sugar annually since the war\nbegan. Prior to the war prac\ntically all the belligerent coun\ntries except the Uuited kingdc m\nand Italy exported sugar, the to\ntal amount being more than 3,\n000,000 tons. In 1918 it is es\ntimated that the allies uu st im\nport a minimum of 1,200,000\ntons.\nand attempts were made to imt\nsubstitutes on the market in the\nform of plated varet.\nrdnaace Equiptneit Ready for Soldiers\nLeaviif for Fraice\nThe Army Ordnance Depart\nment has thus far met every de\nmand imposed by the new pro\ngram for over-seus shipment of\nAmerican troops, according to a\nstatement by the department.\nDespite the great acceleration in\nthe sending of American forces to\nFrance, no iufantryman goes\naboard ship without a United\nStates Model 1917 rifle (modified\nEnfield), bayonet, belt, haver\nsack, puck currier, bandoleers,\nbayonet scabbard, and full mess\nquipment.\nTonnage is today a limiting\n\'actor in the shipment of ord\nnance inate\'riel overseas, espec\nially because of the present ne\ncessity of . increasing the trans\nport of infantry regiments.\nSufficient supplies of artillery\nFrench 75-min. and 155-mru.\nand Ameiicon heavy railway ar-\niltery are already in France to\nuitet the present demand. Suffi\ncient machine guns are also im\nmediately available for Ameri\ncan forces in France. \'\nFor a Bad Cold,\n\'ake (\'hnmberlam\'H Coiiirh Item\ndy. It has stood the test of\nline and can oe depeuued upon\nLOOKING AHEAD.\nIn the minds of the citizens of a de\nmocracy the idea that service is due\nto the government from every one\nmust be firmly implanted or the en\nfranchised cease to be representative\nof such a government.\nThe selective draft answers the pur\npose of this service, from a military\nstandpoint, during the war we are at\npresent engaged In, but largely be\ncause of the fact that we have time to\nprepare while our allies combat the\nenemy. We must look to the future\nand the possibilities of a war declared\nupon us when we will have no ally.\nShould this occur selective conscrip\ntion would be of no avail. Accepting\nthe fact that the citizen of a democ\nracy owes his service to the govern\nment, Is it not logical that we should\norganize this service, which shall be\ntrained and equipped for an emergen\ncy and able to act immediately as a\nperfect machine when the necessity\narises? Few citizens but believe that\nuniversal military training is absolute\nly necessary to the future safety of\ntills country and that this system\nshould be adopted by the government\nat the Hist opportune moment.\nThe speeding up of our plans to win\nthis war should In no way be Inter\nfered with, and future policies must\nbe held in check that they may not In\nterfere wltl the winning-of this war.\nBut when our legislators feel that the\nspeeding up of the war Is accomplish\ned a bill should be panned creating a\nsystem of universal military training\nand service which will amply provide\nfor our country\'s defense in the fu\nture, thereby assuring us against the\ndisaster of nn attack which would find\nus unprepared and completely at the\nmercy of an organized foe,\nTry This For Sour Stomach.\nEat. slnwlv. masticate vru\nfoodl thoroughly.

When the Ger\nman armies made their big advance\nInto France and then retreated Tlr\ntually all the cattle In the Invaded\nterritory approximately 1,800,000\nhead were driven behind the German\nHues. ..... i\nBut In England where 2.400,000!\nacres of pasture lands have been turn\ned Into grain fields the cattle herds\nare decreasing rapidly. One of the\nreasons apparently Is, the declining\nmaximum price scale adopted by the\nEnglish as follows: For\' September,\n$17.70 per 100 pounds ; October, $17.28 ;\nNovember and December, $10.03 ; Jan\nlsry, $14.40. The effect of these prices\nwas to drive beef animals on the mur\nket as soon as possible.\n\' In trance the number of cattle as\nwell as the quality have shown en\nenormous decline during the war.\nWhere France had 14,807,000 head of\ncattle In 1013, she now has only 12,\n841,00011 decrease of 10.0 per cent\nAnd France Is today producing only\none gallon of milk compared to two\nand one-half gallons before the war.\nDenmark and Holland have been\nforced to sacrifice dairy herds for beef\nbecause of the lack of necessary feed.\nClose study of the European meat\nsituation has convinced the Food Ad\nministration that the future problem\nof America lies largely In the produc\ntion of meat producing animals and\ndairy products rather than In the pro\nduction of cereals for export when\nthe war will have ceased.\nThe Woman\'s Tonic\n"I took tour bottles,\'\nMrs. Jones goes on to\nsay, "and was not only\ngreatly relieved, but can\ntruthfully say that 1 have\nnot a pain. . .\n"It has now been two\nyears since I tookCardul,\nand I am still in good\nhealth. . . 1 would ad\nvise any woman, or girl\nto use Cardui who is a\nsufferer from any female\ntrouble."\nIf yon sufferpaln caused\nfrom womanly trouble, or\nif you feel the need of a\ngood strengthening tonic\nto build up your run-do wn\nsystem, take the advice\nof Mrs.ijones.
