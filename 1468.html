Hitler and the German war, lords have been wiped from power. The Nazis regime fell, before the combined strength of the Allies and peace came, again to the war wrecked countries. , *, A man carrying an umbrella cried appeasement while Hit, ler’s troops stormed across the continent. An isolationist, nation across the Atlantic refused to heed the undercurrents, of a world wide aggression. But, war did come and after the, British had valiantly staved off total invasion, the United, States entered the fight after the disaster at Pearl Harbor., Our country resorted to dropping the atomic bomb on civil, ians and now we are fearful °f some intercontinental ballistic, missle or chemical attack. The horrors of Nagasaki and Po, land are faint memories to many people. We must remember, that the past and the present are not too far apart. As long as, nations exist there will be some summit meetings and some, diplomatic failures., A cold war is a great improvement over a hot war. Don’t, be deluded into thinking that another Pearl Harbor is im, possible. It would be better to think about past events before, we stumble through the present., Discussing Arizona Law, In a nation under law, a government’s chief lawyer be, comes a key officer. The idea comes to us from Thirteenth, Century England where an attorney general advised the king., Today the U.S. Attorney General is a member of the Presi, - dent’s cabinet., During the early days of the Territory of Arizona, the at, * torney general was appointed by the Territorial Governor., Since statehood in 1912, he has been elected by the people., Arizona Attorney General advises all state agencies of, their rights and duties under law, and helps all law enforce, ment agencies. He stands ready to assist the 14 county at, torneys who may calKon him to help investigate or prosecute, a case. His assistants handle all cirminal appeals in higher, courts., The Legislature, the Governor, district attorneys, County, counsels, and State agencies look to him for legal advice., He usually represents the state when anyone sues Arizona., Some law suits over taxes, water, oil, or land rights may in, volve thousands of dollars., To handle these problems the Attorney General directs, * more than 25 lawyers and 12 other employees in offices in, Tucson and Phoenix. /, This legal column is issued as a public service under, supervision of the State Bar of Arizona and is written to, inform not to advise., I HODqzg i The|ma \' 0 ?

Central, Page 2, SIGHTS AND, SOUNDS, by Eloise Banks, One .bit of my curious mind, has been relieved. A ques, tion that has plagued me for, many years has been an, swered. It is a load off of, the gray matter which is con, fronted by the daily .process, es of deciding where po sit, or how many slices of bread, to eat., A burning query for years, has been: ‘ what type of, children were these child de, velopment specialists’’ and, “What kind of a boy was Dr., Spock?’’, For the uninitiated into the, world of Dr. Spock and Ms, confederates, I will des, cribe for you 3 ome of the, Spockisms or child develop, ment thoeries or rail ing or, is it rearing children., These learned men and, women have studied the be, havior of those darling mon, sters known as “a chip off, the old block”, “baby dum, plin”, “Junior”, or “Mom, ma’s little helper”. To us,, we know them as progenies,, population increasers, sit, ter’s terror or granny’s deer, ling. What Gertrude Stein, wrote about a rose by any, other name would smell as, sweet goes double for child, ren. Call them what you may, —they are sometimes the best, and the worst—but still we, love them., The child specialist has, enriched the literary shelves, i f this nation with thousands, of volumes on “How To Be A, Parent” or “How Not To Be, A Prrent”. Dr. Spock and, his ilk have taken the switch, from the parents and they, have armed the children with, more lethal weapons of un, controlled .ries, unstopped, and unchecked, tempers. Parents are cau, tioned to let the child have, freedom until the parents, are practically enslaved by, the fat-cheeked tyrant of, the Three cornered pants., One group of specialists, urge parents to ignore the, crying child while another, group demands attention to, his every gurgle. “To spank, or not to spank” has become, the topic for all young par, ents. Now, they can at least, have a reply to Dr. Spock., His mother related his early, days in a recent article. She, said he was the eldest of, six children and he was a, good boy. Benny (Dr. Benja, min Spock) dirtied his clothes, like any good American boy, and he was spanked., Now we can worry about, another facet of child be, havoir -- “Should children, have chores” or “How much, allowance shouli« a girl of, thirteen get.” If you can, think of enough confusing, and contradictory conclusion, you may become the suc, cessor to Dr. Spock., ■HSHEHSHHSE2SSSSSESSSSSSKS&, Duchess, Beauts Shop, 2351 E.

In England, the fanciest restaurants serve, animal innards with no downward glance at the hungry patron., In this country, however, people seem to muzzle their taste, for such dishes and feel that only the uncouth or poverty, stricken partake of such menus., Liver, brains, sweetbreads, kidneys, tongue, and tripe are, delicacies worth the time and effort in procuring and preparing, them., A favorite breakfast meal cbnsists of fried bacon, beef or, lamb kidneys, a slice of ham and scrambled eggs, served with, toast and tea. These innards are tasty Tor any meal. Consult, any recipe liook and you will be delighted with the delicious, ways to prepare veal heart, calf’s liver or lamb kidneys., On many Furopean menus, these innards are disguised, with beautiful sounding titles—for example—tripe a la mode de, caen. This is. merely the inner lining of the stomach of beef, in a casserole with onions, carrots, shallots, wine, celery, and seasonings., Chitterlings (the innards of a pig) are desirable, on any, Englishman’s plate. Americans scorn this dish openly but, thousands devour it secretly., Sweetbreads are the thymus glands of lamb, beef and calf., Calf sweetbreads are the tenberest and the sweetest. They, are tastily prepared in white wine with mushrooms., One of the best night snacks can be made with cold beef, tongue slices and horseradish sauce. Lamb tongue is equally, delicious., During my African sojourn, I was served a native dish, called palm chop. Rice, fish, meat and palm oil were pre, pared by the cooks and no forks were used. We dipped our, hand into a large bowl and enjoyed every mouthful., French and Italian chefs are still the best in the world., But no one can brew a better cup of tea than, Nothing will ever take the place of a hot cup of tea for any, ailments or aches. Americans have ruined tea by serving it, cold in tall, icy glasses with lemon., iSAVE! TAKE HOME !, j SCHLIJZPAKgpi, cost \'/3 more *’|s9, y \', Stone\'s Pharmacy, 4327 So.
