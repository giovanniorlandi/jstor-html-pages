MAY 28, 1904., No. 22, K, it, 7, f, INSTRUCTED FOR HEARST., Arizona Democratic Convention, at Tucson,, on Monday Have a Real Nice Time, Ben Crawford National Committeeman., The Democratic Territorial conven, tion held at Tucson, on Monday,, elected the following delegates \'to tho, riatlonal convention: W. A. Gilles, pie, of Graham county, Carl Hayden,, Of Maricopa county, John Lawler,, of Yavapai county; J. S. Taylor, of, Cochise county, and Isaac Bartb, of, Apache county, and W. P. Timmons,, Yuma-county., The following are the alternates, chosen: M. \'J. Samaniego, of Pima, county; Win, Schuckmau, of Sania, Cruz county, Geo. P. Blair, of Pinal, county, R. J. Holmes, of Mohave, county, T. A. Rlordan, of Coconino, county and W. A. Parr, of Navajo, county., Ben M. Crawford of Graham county,, was endorsed for member of the na, tional committee., The platform reaffirms the principles, of the national platform at Chicago, and Kansas City, deplores the diplo, macy of the Roosevelt administration, in acquiring the isthmus of Panama,, hits the trusts pretty hard, praises, Bryan, acknowledges the faithiul ser, vice of Delegate Wilson, glorifies, Hearst and instructs the delegates to, the national convention to vote for, him and use all honorable efforts to, effect his nomination., It was a Hearst convention almost, solidly, says the Republican. The, only contest was over the delegation, from Gila county and thi? was finally, settled by the convention seating both, delegations and splitting the vote., The regulars headed by J. H. Hamlll,, of Globe, and Attorney George J., Stoneman would not accept the com, promise and left tho convention. The, contesting delegation was headed by, Aionzo Bailey., Pima county, which instructed its, delegation to support John T. Hughes,, of the Arizona Star, for delegate to thei, national convention was shown no, favor. Hughes received only the votes, of his own delegation and M. G., Samaniego, of Tucson, who was ini, mical to Hughes, was elected alternate, to the national convention., It was pretty clear to the delegates, that Hughes was put up to humiliate, Mark Smith and Smith\'s friends were, in an overwhelming majority in the, convention and they smashed Hughes, without mercy., The work of the convention was ar, tistic. Tho delegates, alternates and, national committeemen were bunched, in a resolution, the previous question, ordered and after a minlture riot by, Hughes and a few friends the slate, went through, the Pima delegation, only, dissenting., The Maricopa delegation was ex, tremely active and influential. The, platform was written by W. B. Cleary, and was reported by Brady O\'Neill, as chairman of tho committee. The, Maricopa delegation organized the, fight on John T. Hughes and claim, whatever credit Is attached to smash, ing him., There was a sharp contest among, the Maricopa men for the national, committeemanship. Tom Parish and, Brady O\'NelM being aspirants. It, soon became apparent that neither, would make in and O\'Neill withdrew., The delegation then withdrew Parish, and Ben Crawford had a walkover, for the honor., Delegate Wilson was there, but re, ceived a cold reception., Mark Smith returned frotri tho City, of Mexico last night and when he ap, peared at the Santa Rita hotel he re, ceived an ovation. Wilson was much, in evidence until Smith returned, but, after that be ceased to be conspicu, ous. The real work of the convention, the, endorsement Of Hearst, was directed, by M. P. Tarpey and "Blinker", Murphy, of San Francisco, who kept, open bouse at the Santa Rita hotel., The oratory of the convention was, very commonplace, the worst contri, bution having been made by Kean St., Charles of Mohave. Mark Smith did, not appear in the convention, but he, told his friends "on the quiet" that, he would be in the race for delegate, to congress this fall., The Trout fishers., The trout fishing season opens on, next Tuesday. The Flagstaff fisber, meri are all ready fof the opening, abd, their fishing tackle is being looked, over by them every day. They have, every sort of tackle that is made for, tho fisher of trout, and each ono takes, great pride in showing his outfit to, the fellow who cannot get away to go, fishing and making him fell bad. But, the same fellow wishes the fisherman, good luck and a good time, and trusts, that he may not suffer from snake, bite. One of the parties who will have, a good time and catch their quota of, trout is composed of Mark A. Smith,, oi Tucson; E. M. Doe, H. C. Hibben,, E. A. Sliker, John G. Verkamp, T., J. Coalter and Leo Verkamp. They, will make the. L. V. Thomas ranch, their headquarters during their stay, on Oak Creek., Not Correctly Quoted., During bis recent visit to Prescott, Col. J. F. Wilson was asked by the, Journal-Miner editor If be had been, correctly quoted by the St. Louis, Globe-Democrat correspondent in Hay, ing that he would not be a candidate, for re-election as delegate to congress., Colonel Wilson, with considerable, emphasis, said that he had not. That, he had not.glven out any intimation, whatever that could be construed in, such a manner, the Inference from, what he said and the manner of its, saying being that the colonel would, be found on the track with colors dy, ing when the next race for delegate, is on., New Tire Limit, The town council has amended the, ordinance with reference to the blocks, in which no wooden buildings can be, built, and now If you build in the fol, lowing boundaries you must build of, some fire-proof material: All of, blocks numbered 4, 6, 6, and 18; the, west half of block 17; the northwest, half of the south half of block 6 w.,, and all the right of way of the Santa, Fe railroad between Beaver and Agas, siz south of blocks numbered 4, 5, and, 6.- This is a good move on the part, of the council, and will be better still, if the ordinance is strictly enforced., EDISON\'S LATEST., TH "Wizard" to Our Greatest Public Bene, factor It He Has Done This., Mr. Thomas A. Edison has just con, sented! to thrill the public once more, by announcing the perfection of an, invention which will not only put the, horse out of business but will bring, tbe gas companies down with a sick, ening crash. In an interview tbe, Wizard of Menlo Park declared the, other day that he had just perfected, an electrical generator which derives, its power from "fuel" of marvelous, potency and which will make it possi, ble for the day laborer, as well as the, multi-millionaire, to light bis borne, with electricity and have an automo, bile For a few cents a day light and, power may be produced in sufficient, quantities to supply the needs of any, family, and the generator is so simple, according to the inventor, that any, person Of ordinary intelligence can act, as engineer. Referring to bis inven, tion, Mr. Edison said:, "You can wire your home for elec, tric\' bells, telephone from room to, room or for anything that electricity, will do, and the batteries In your auto, mobile will operate them. The cost?, It is so trifling after you are provided, with your plant that it is not worth, mentioning. We will use the word, fuel for want of a better word just at, present to apply to the means by, which it is operated. Tbe fuel used, in this machine is one that has never, before been used as a fuel under these, conditions.", We can assure Mr. Edison that if, his invention will, as he says else, where in his interview, solve the stor, age battery question, provide a re, liable power for vehicles without be, ing cumbersome or weighty, and at, tbe same time enable the owner of a, $430 generator he says the cost will, be materially reduced as soon as, proper facilities for manufacturing the, generators can be had to quit pay, ing gas bills he will have little trouble, in getting himself accepted as the, greatest benefactor of the age.-Chicago, Record Herald., Walon Seat Brake., While Ned Robinson was driving a, horse to a road cart Tuesday even, ing, and when in front of Miss, Wynne\'s millnery store on Aspen, avenue, the seat broke down and Rob, inson fell to the ground. He was, picked up by J. Herman, who wit, nessed the accident. He was taken to, the office of Doctor Adams and his in, juries dressed, which consisted of tbe, loss of an eye and a number of cuts, on tho head, the most serious injury, being the crushing of bones from the, eye to the ear. The injured man, shows improvement, and If no com, plications set-!" the chances for his, recovery are favorable., Bis Mlnlns Sale., Final payment of $70,000 has been, made for the Clipper group of copper, mines, situated eight miles west of, Globe. This sum is in addition to, $lo.O0O previously paid. The pur, chaser is the Pacifio Mining and, Metals company, represented by its, general managers J. D. Coplen, and, S. M. Ashenfelter. The sellers are, William H. Beard, to whom half of, purchase price has been paid, and, Charles Holzman and W. H. Wood, son. Beard Is already wealthy through, the sale, several years ago, of tbe, Black Warrior mines in the same, locality. In ordef to fill all the terms, of the agreement, the Metals company, made tender of the $70,000 in actual, gold coin, sent to Globe under guard, from EI Paso. The company has, bonds on several other mines near, the Clipper. It is believed tbe prop, erty will become one of the heaviest, producers of the camp. Silver Belt., Arizona O. A. R., The annual encampment of the G. A., R. held at Prescott, Wednesday was, not largely attended, those present be, ing mostly from Phoenix and Prescott., In spite of tbe small attendance, how, ever the veterans enjoyed their day\'s, session to the utmost., The session was called to. order by, I. M. Christy, who delivered the an, nual address of the commander of the, department., Major Christy was elected depart, ment commander for the ensuing year;, Winfield Scott was re-elected chaplain;, W. F. R. Schindler was chosen de, partment adjutant hnd Col. J. H., Creighton was chosen delegate to tbe, national convention which is to be, held in Boston. Tbe other offices went, to outside posts., Although the ladies had prepared a, nice spread for the G. A. R. Wednes, day night, several of tbe delegates, wished to return to their homes, so it, was necessary to cut the celebration, short. Ice cream and cake were, served during the afternoon. The, next annual encampment will be held, in Phoenix next April., Examination of Forests., Thus far in the season Mr. Henry, Gannett, geographer of the United, States Geographical Survey, has or, dered only two parties into the field, for the examination of forests and the, classification of lands., One party, consisting of Messrs., Fred G. Plummer and M. G. Gowsell,, is examining the Santa Barbara Re, serve in California. On completing, that work they will turn their atten, tion to the mountains in the neigh, borhood of San Luis Obispo, in the, same state. The second party, under, Mr. T. F. Rixon is examining the, mountains southwest of Albuquerque,, New Mexico. This land has been re, served, and the examination is made, in order to determine whether it, would be advisable to create there a, forest reserve., Opposed Instructed Delegation., J. E. Ruffln returned Thursday night, from attending the Democratic Terri, torial convention at Tucson. Mr., Ruffln says that while the convention, Instructed the delegates for Hearst,, not all tbe delegates to the convention, were in favor of instructions. He, was a member of all the cdmmittees of, the convention, and was opposed to, sending an instructed delegation to, St. Louis, and be insisted tbat bis, sentiment be made a part of the re, cord of the convention, which was, done after considerable effort on his, part. Mr. Ruffln was delighted with, Tucson and its people, the city having, ample accommodation for large pub, lic gatherings., avea;:, hg&sV$$K, ;se?hs, a lf sv-c, . - \'i]', '[,\'\'.\'\', JSSft, &, 4S \',, 3V, &nKy, ?K "a, COCONINO SUN., tV Vi\'l; .iutflyi\'VV\'\'"";\'-, Oldest Bell In the United State., The oldest boll in the United States, has just been acquired by Gov. M. A., Otero und will bo exhibited in the New, Mexico building at St. Louis, says the, Denver Republican. Tho history of, tho boll is interesting, tho data being, furnished by Father Coudert, of Ber, nalillo. The bell was brought from Spain on, one of tho first expeditions to Mexico, by Father Juan de Padllla, one of the, Franciscan fathers, who accompanied, Coronado to New Mexico. It was, hung in ono of the mission churches, established in ono of the seven cities, of Clbollu. From there it was taken, to Gran Quivera, where it was hung, in a church of which the ruins are, still visible. From Gran Quivera it, was taken to Algodones, where it has, hung- in the parish church ever since., Father Padilla was killed by his, guides while on the way from Gran, Quivera to Algodones., The bell weighs exactly 103 pounds., It was baptized Maria Josefa. It was, cast in the year A. D. 1355, according, to the inscription which is cast in the, bell. The "F" in the word Jesefa is, inverted, and the letters "S" and "E", are transposed, the mistake evidently, having been made in the mould., The bell is supposed to contain con, siderable gold and silver, as it was, the custom in olden times for the de, vout to cast gold and silver orna, ments in bell metal just as it was, poured into the mold. Naturally a, bell 545 years old, antedating the dis, covery of America by 137 years, is, quite a curiosity, and will attract, more attention at the World\'s Fair,, probably, than any other object ex, hibited. The bell Is one year older than the, famous old bell in San Miguel church,, which was brought to the western con, tinent from Spain by the Spaniards in, the same expedition that brought the, Algodones bel., President Udall and words of cheer, from from friends and relatives, a, bounteous feast was indulged in, and, at 1 o\'clock the happy pair departed, on their honeymoon. May their path, be strewn with roses. St. Johns Her, ald., Bit Sale of Wool Clips., Two of the biggest clips of wool in, tho West have changed hands during, tho past few days.

Salt Lake News., Cured Hla Mother of Rheumatism, "My mother has been a sufferer for, many years with rheumatism," says, W. H. Howard, of Husband, Pa. "At, times sho was unable to move at all,, while at all times walking was pain, ful. I presented her with a bottle of, Chamberlain\'s Pain Balm, and after, a few applications she decided it was, tho most wonderful pain reliever she, had ever tried, in fact, sho is never, without it now and is at all times able, to walk.
