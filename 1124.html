JUNE 13, 908\nNUMBER 17\niff\n1\n1 r\n.1\n1\n,\nJ\'\nit-\nRefuse to\nEndorse\nTreasurer Campbell", Choice\nTurned Down.\nThe County Executive Coinniittee\nof the Republican party held a meet\ning Wednesday as is their custom.\nThe matter of the greatest interest\nto the members of the party was the\nconsideration of the request of Treas\nurer A. J. Campbell that they en\ndorsb Joseph S. Kuncwa for the\nposition of Tax Assessor of Maui.\nBefore the committee had met it\nwas evident that no matter how\nmuch they might have wished to\nendorse the choice of the treasurer\nit was certain they would not do so\non account of the strong opposition\nthat lias developed.\nMaui citizens are a unit in their\nbehalf that there are good, honest,\ncapable men who could fill theoiliee\nto the entire satisfaction of all but\nchronics and that the oflice should\ngo to a Maui man after due con\nsideration the committee decided to\nendorse all of the candidates who\nhave applied. A resolution was in\ntroduced and unamiously carried to\nthat effect.\nThose endorsed are W. A. McKay\nS. Keliinoi and L. M. Baldwin.\nThe committee endorsed the ap\nplications of men for inspectors of\nelection this fall.\nShipments Reach\n$20,000,000 Mark.\nThe sugars shipped this season\nfrom Hawaii which have reached\nthe market have now hit the 20-million-dollar\nmark.\nThe Sugar Factors Company has\ncompiled figures showing that up\nuntil June 1 the total amount of\nsugar shipped by the plantations\ncontroled by it amounted to 258,\n582 tons, of which amount 200,254\ntons had reached the market\', leav\ning a balance of 58,328 tons still\nafloat.\nAll of this sugar has been shipp\ned by Bteamer with the exception\nof that brought to the market by\nthe Erskin M. Phelps and tho Fort\nGeorge, which are tho first of the\nCape Horn fleet to have reached\ntheir destination. The Phelps left\nFeb. 19 and arrived at New York\nMay 28, thus making the voyage\nin 99 days. The Fort George left\nFeb. 18 and arrived May 29, mak\ning the trip in 101 days. The\nPhelps carried 5.100 tons and the\nFort George 3,000 tons the cargoes\nfetching probably 4.27 cents a\npound.\nThe average price received for\nall the Sugar mentioned above was\n4.175 cents a pound, or $83.50 a\nton. Figuring the total at 2\'J0,000\ntons, tho price received by the\nSugar Factors\' sugar amounts in\nround numbers to $10,700,000.\nTHE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF WAILUKU\nClias. M. Cooke, President W. T.

Case, 2nd Vice-l\'resideut of\nluat the above statement is true to the\nSubscribed and sworu to before me\nPoliticians\nDebate\nInteresting Story told of J,\nL. Coke and I. Garcia.\nThe San Francisco Examiner of\nMay 30th, has the following in\nteresting story of the trip of two\nwell known Wailuku citizens that\nwhile- denied by each of the princi\npals is given for what it is worth.\n"Boots, shoes, portions of steamer\nchairs and chunks of sea biscuits\nfound their way by night to the\ndoor and into tho stateroom of\nMessrs. J. L. Coke and J. (iarcia,\non their voyage over from Hono\nlulu on the liner Manchuria, which\narrived yesterday. The two men\nare national dolegates from the is\nland of Maui, Democratic and Re\npublican respectively, and by the\nfortunes of polfties they were as\nsigned to one and the same state\nroom. "Politics does make strange bed\nfollows," they remarked philoso\nphically, and turned in to rest.\nRut they didn\'t. Neither did\nthose around them. Coke began\nto wonder how Garcia could vote\nfor any one except the peerless\nleader, and Garcia thought deeply\nfor a time and then decided that\nit was but a strange mischance that\nled Coke any way but Taft-ward.\nAnd then they started the six\nday argument. It wasn\'t so bad\nat first, the sleepless\' passengers\nstated yesterday, because it began\nlow and evenly, and merged into\nthe lapping of the waves.\nBut the sound of the argument\ngrew. It penetrated the next state\nroom, and then stole farther down\nthe corridor and crept into other\nrooms, and still others, booming\nout into the steerage finally and\narousing tho heathen ire of the\nhorde of celestials there.\nAnd it could not be stopped, or\neven stemmed. It flowed as na\nturally as tho babbling streams,\nand as resistlcssly as the raging\ntorrents. Every morning the in\ndefatigable delegates crawled out\nfrom the mountain of missiloa and\nstarted tho endless argument after\na hasty breakfast, and every night\ntheir voices kept time to the pound\ning of the steamer\'s engines or,\nas some declare the engines kept\ntimo to the voices.\nAnd ttie surprising part of it is\nthat Coke is still a firm Democrat,\nand Garcia an adamantine Repub\nlican." To this amount must be added\nthe sugars sent from Hawaii by\nplantations outside of the Sugar\nfactors. It is estimated that of\nthis about hfty thousand tons must\nhave reached the market by this\ntime, and, valuing this at the same\nrate as tho others, would make the\ngross value on the whole total\n$4,175,000, or a total value of all\nthe Hawaiian sugars from Hawaii\nmarketed, of nearly $21,000,000.\nMAHIMTIRS\nCapital Stock. .7 $ 35,000.00\nSurplus and I\'rofits 20,821.29\nCirculation 16,500.00\nDue to Hanks 14,346.16\nDividends Unpaid 1,400.00\nDeposits 161,168,15\n249.235-6\nthe nlxve named bank, do solemnly swear\nbest ol my knowledge and Delict.\nD.

All\'of the members were pre\nsent and the reading of the minutes\nof tho last convention was the first\nthing under the ordci of business.\nThe minutes were found correct\nand approved as read.\nA number of communication\nwere then taken up.\nA communication from the Ho\nnolulu Iron Works was rend relat\ning to the bill of lading for the\ntraction engine shipped. Action\non this communication as well as\notherconimunications was deferred.\nA communication from the Wnt\nerhouse Company stating that they\nhad sent an adding machine to the\ncounty clerk for the freo use of the\ncounty officials for.a period of one\nmonth was read.\nCounty Attorney 1). H. Case\nwrote the board that he had receiv\ned the instructions from tho board\nto have a deed executed by W. T.\nRobinson for the property on which\npart of the sidewalk i.f Market\nstreet is laid but was unable to get\nthe data necessary to draw up the\ndeed before Mr. Robinson left the\nTerritory.\nThe County Attorney wrote that\nthe Manager of the Kaeleku Sugar\nCompany had stated to him that\nhe had not been given written\nauthority to make leases of lands\nbelonging to the company although\nsuch authority had been voted by\nthe company and that he had been\ninformed verbal ly of their action.\nFor this reason the lease of a small\npiece of land sought by the county\nfor road purposes would havo to\ncome from the officers of the com\npany of Honolulu.\nThe County Attorney w ote that\nit was tin the power of the county\nboard to purchaso a Colts automa\ntic gun if they felt the same should\nbe bought. He also wrote them\ninforming them of tho names of\ncertain gentlemen of Honolulu\nwho were duly authorized to sign\nsurety bonds.\nIn regard to the papers necessary\nto bring an injunction suit agains;\ntho Pioneer Mill Company, he stat\ned that they were ready and in the\nhands of the Attorney General but\nthat the Manager of the Company\nhad stated to him that the com\npany did not consider the matter\nof sufficient importance to go to\nlaw and had abandoned the use of\nthe land sought by the County for\nroad purposes and was willing to\nallow the county to ufo tho land\nfor road purposes provided the titje\nto the land should remain in tho\ncompany and revert to the com\npany when the public no longer re\nquired the use of the land for road\npurposes.\nThe Vireles3 Telegraph Com\npany wrote the Board that tho\nneceseary amount had not as yet\nbeen guaranteed to justify them\nto open their station in Mo\'okai\nbut that they believed it soon\nwould bo and that when this was\ndone they would open the station\nthere and sign the contract sent\nthem by tho Board.\nThe resignation of County Attor\nney was read and was worded as\nfollows:\nWailuku\', June 5th, 1908.\nTo tho Honorable Board of Super\nvisors within and for the County\nof Maui, Wailuku, Maui.\nChased\nthe China\nC. G. White Missed His Boat\nCaught Her in Stream.\nC. G. White, the pineapple man\nof Maui, son of the nianufactuicr\nof tho White steamer, who arrived\nin this city this morning on tho\nChina, had a great experience when\ncaving San Francisco this trip.\nAnd it was all due to an automo\nbile. Mr. White was at the steamer,\nand his wife, with their little child,\nwas on the Oakland side, coming\nover in an auto. But the auto got\na tire punctured, a ferry boat was\nmissed, and tho arrival of Mrs.\nWhite at the wharf delayed. Mean\nwhile Mr. White was pacing up\nand down the pier, with a watch\n111 his hand, as the hour for sailing\ndrew nearer and nearer. At the\nlast minute, he was forced to con\nclude that his wife was not coming,\nhad his baggage thrown out, and\nresigned himself to wait for the\nnext steamer to Honolulu.\nThe lines wore cast off , tho China\nmoved out into the stream. Just as\nthe gangplank came down, Mrs.\nWhite arrived on the wharf, in a\nfrantic hurry too late.\nTho Maui man proved the exis\ntence of his bump of resource. He\ngot his family and baggage on a\ntug, and gave chase to the big liner\nso successfully that ho was among\nthe arrivals in Wailuku by the\nMauna Kea Tuesday.\nGentlemen; I herewith tender\nmy resignation as County Attorney,\nthe same to take effect on tho first\nday of July, 190S.\nI shall consider it my duty, and\nit will certainly be my pleasure to\nassist in the trial and find disposi\ntion, of any cases, in the result of\nwhich the County of Maui may be\ndirectly interested, now pending\nand undetermined, in either the\nCircuit or Supreme Courts.\nAny service I can at any time\nrender to the County, and which\nwill not conflict with the duties I owe\nto others, will he gladly extended\nI desire to thank each member of\nyour Honorable body for the cour\ntesies and kindnesses from time to\ntime shown to ine during .\' mv in\ncumbency in ollice.\nVery Respectfully\nD. II. CASK.\nTho members of the board were\nsurprised the.t Mr. Case should wish\nto resign and as\'ed him to re-eon\nsider his determination. Mr. Case\nthanked the members of tho Board\nfor their kindly words but said that\nho had felt for some lime that he\nshould take a vacation on account\nof his health and that ho had held\nthe ollice- to his financial detriment\nand that in justice to himself and\nfamily he felt that he should take\ntho step he did.

II. Case. Case comes as o surprise to all except his\nintimate friends who have known for some time that he intended\nto present his resignation at this meeting of the Hoard, i\nThe record of Mr. Case is an enviable one and is a credi to the\nparty that has t wice elected him to the ollice.\nMr. Case has at all times sought to prosecute all cases in an able\nand conscientious manner where he felt the one accused was guilty\nof a crime but has steadily refused to allow the persecution of an\ninnocent person solely for the pecuniary profit of a third person.\nIt seems\' to us that this is a just course and one that should be\nfollowed by all who would see the guilty brought to justice and\nequally opposed to the conviction of the innocent even if by some\ntechnicality it were possible for the prosecuting ollicer to secure a\nconviction.\nMr. Case has at no lime swerved from what he considered a\n..inin rintv nn1 will return to m-ivate practice with a clear con\nscience and the respect and confidence of the better element of the\ncommunity.\nCitizen This paper has at all times been ready to support the\nI ahor. principle of citizen labor and believes in citizen labor\nfor all public work of every nature and we would be glad to see all\nskilled labor of every nature in the territory done by cmzens re\neardless of whether the work is for public or private purposes\nWe fail to see the justice of the charges of the Honolulu Trades\naud Labor Council, however m its cote plaint against contractor\nMcDonald.\nWe know that no Oriental was even allowed to come on or near\nthe work from the time it first started and yet the charge is made\nthat he employed or knowingly permitted to bo employed in and\nabout the building, persons other than citizens of the United\nStates.\nOn all government work in the United States any one who is\neligible to become a citizen is allowed to work on government work\nand we see no reason why the line should be more sharply drawn\nhere.\nThe greatest objection to the work of Contractor McDonald is\n"that the greater part of the mill work and interior finish in said\nbuilding, including window, door and casement Irames, lattice\ngates, etc., and the cutting smoothing and sandpapering in connec\nt; thorovrit Vi wile Hone bv non citizen (Oriental) labor by and\nwith the knowledge of the said McDonald or under his direct pro\ncurement." This is the charge made by the Council at the in\nstance of one who for personal reasons is out for the scalp of Mr\nMcDonald.\nIt may be true that the factories where the nails were made that\nwere used in the building employed Orientals or even worse, it\nmay be true that Orientals were employed in the factory where\nthe bluing was manufactured employed labor oi the same class as\nno one knows where any of those materials were wade nor by\nwhom, It may be true that V. J. Moody employed Orientals in\nthe mill to dress some of the material bought of the Kahulai Kail\nroad Company by the contractor but can this be construed by the\nauthorities as the employment of Orientals? We imagine not.\nWe know that the contractor never allowed Orientals, on or\nabout the premises while he was here much less did he employ\nthem and we know too that he refused to allow the e-nployment of\nOrientals on the drays that hauled the material for the building\nand yet the charge is made that he employed or knowingly per\nmitted to be employed in aud about the construction ot the buna\ning etc.\nThe action of the Trades and Labor Council in putting its foot\njnto this matter is a most unwise act and will lesson the ultimate\nconsummation of the object of the Council naimMy the betterment\nof the conditio of citizen labor in the Territory.\nBY AUTHORBTY.\nThat K. P. In our last issue of the .News we published a\nRino Btatenient in connection with the (ire at the\na v " "\nKnights of Pythias Hall that Young Tung had tried to get central\nbut failing to do so had aroused the neighbors and put out the lire\nThe statement was made by one of the most responsible c\'uizens\nof Wailuku who was present at the fire and assisted in extinguish\ning it. The statement was made without reservation to C. D. Luf\nkin. cashier of the First National Bank and H. M. Coke of the New\nnnrl nthprs The statement was at least in part orilied by the\nCentral oprator on the same day the statement was made and fully\nverified by Young Tung on Saturday evening after the publication\nof the article -when he stated to the ediror of the news that the ac\ncount in the paper was correct. He stated further that he ran\nmany limes and that it was from ten to fifteen minutes after ho\nrang before he got central.\nThe statement of C. H. CI. Hrau u who was on duty that night\nwas made in this otlioe tlijs week and explains the statement first\nmade by Young Tuug and is practically corroborated by Yyung\nTung who now states that ho was very much excited that night\nand that he may have jiad the ear phone down when he was trying\nto get central. Of course if that was the case no blame canbo at\ntached to central as it would be impossible to get central if the\near phone was down\nThe News never knowingly does any one a wrong and yet its\nbusiness is to get news for the public and publish the, same on\nwhat it considers good authority.\nThe statement published.in this paper of last week that Young\nTung tried to get central and failed is again vouched for by him\nand is doubtless true. His statement of this week however that\nowing to his excitement he may have had the ear phouo down en\ntirely ex-honerates the Telephone Company or its employees of any\nblame.\nMaunaolu Si \'miliary \'was favored\nith a perfect day for their Third\n(\'oiiiliieiiecnielit which Has held\nTuesday June Uth. at \'.::\'.( in the\nmorning.\n(treat credit is due the teachers\nfor the admirable work of the year.\nMl told it has undoubtedly bet n by\nfar the best year in the history of\nthe school.\nThe nine graduates of this year\'s\nlass read essays of thoughtful\niiiracter, many of which were ex\nceptionally well written, and one or\ntwo were recited with hardly a\nglance at the manuscript.

W\nRose for $21.25, wo recommend that\nit be not paid, not because tho work\nhas not been properly and satisfac\ntorily performed by Mr. Rose, but\nbecause your Committee is of the\nopinion that the Territorial govern\nment should pay it. The County\nhas always paid the expenses of\npulling the engines to and from the\nfircsalso the monthly re pairings of\nthe fire-engine and hose cart and\nother incidental expenses. And with\nthe above, the County has been pay\ning $40.00 monthly for tho Janitor\nor Watchman at the Fire Station\nWo are of the opinion that matters\npertaining to hydrants, for which\nthis bill was incurred, the Territory\nshould pay, as it is a matter con\nnected with its water-works from\nwhich the Territory is receiving\ngoodly revenue, and because it 13\nalso the duty of tho Territory to\nprotect the property of its tax-payers.\nIn this connection, wo desire\nfurther to say, that wo have been\ninformed that more rcpairings of\nsimilar nature as we have now un\nder consideration will bo necessary\nand so, if this claim should bo paid\nit would bo the beginning of a series\nof claims that may mean a big out\nlay.\nFirst of the Junketing Bills\nIn ro demands Nos. 2070, 2071\n2073, 2074, 2075, 2070, 2077, 207S\nand 2070, incurred by the Roads\nand Bridges Committee, amounting\nto $70.95, your Committee recom\nmend bo not allowed, tho same be\ning not authorized by the Board\nAll of which is respectfully sub\nmitted,\n, Chairman\nG.D.

It was decided in\nthe way it always is when brought\nup that tho teachers as a rule fail\nto receive what their services are\nworth. There was nothing to be\ndone about it, however, and the\nsalarie -;ro left alone, pending\nthe acti i of tho next Legislature.\nSupi inteddent Babbitt, F. f . P.\nWatcrhoiise, Judge Perry, and\nJohn Carden were present when\nthe meeting was called to order.\nTho first question was tho provid\ning of a school to serve tho districts\nof Honokowai and Kaanapali. At\nthe latter camp there are from 50\nto 00 children, mostly Japanese,\nwhile attending the Kaanapali\nschool an; 31 children, mostly 11a\nwaiians. Mr. Babbitt recommended\nenliiiging the present school rather\nthan moving it closer to tho camp.\nThio was agreed to. .\nAuthority was given the Super\nintendent to exchange the present\nschool sits at Olowala for a larger\nand bettor one. Thu present site is\nwanted by the plantation, while\nthe Superintendent wanted the new\nsite. Another transfer at Kaluaaba\nwas agreed to.\nThere was a discussion regard\ning attempt to keep Mr. Dona\nhue at the High School, he having\nbeen offered a position with tho\nAgricultural College. The Super\nintendent thought the Board had\nno ri,ht to hold him because it.\ncould not afford to pay him what\nhe was worth. Mr. Carden sug\ngested offering him $150 a month\nto stay, an increase of $25. If ho\niccepted, it would do away with\nhaving to look for another mathe\nmatical teacher.\nMr. WaterhoiiRc thought the\nquestion to bo decided was whether\nthe arranged schedules should be\nstuck to or whether any exceptions\nshould be n:ade in exceptional\ncases. lo make an exception\nwould make trouble.\nThis brought about the old ques\ntion of the salaries paid teachers\nin general. Judge Perry thought\nthat half tho teachers were getting\nless than their services entitled\nthem to, and Mr. Watcrhouso\nthought the whole schedule should\nbe boosted. The Superintendent\npromised to ask the next Legisla\nture for enough to bring about an\nother general raise.\nThe question of raising Mr.\nDonahue\'s salary went over for a\nspecial meeting, Mr. Babbitt stat\ning that a request for an increased\nsalary might be expected from Mr.\nBlanchard of tho High School.\nA chango in the terms was au\nthorized, the long vacation being\nshifted forward a week, commenc\ning one week later than now and\nextending through tho first week of\nSeptember.\nMr. Babbitt roported that the\nteachers\' meetings had recommend\ned that a now grade be established\nat tho Grammar School, a special\ngrade in which the graduates \'of\nthe public schools could be prepar\ned for entrance tu tho High School.\nThe recommendation was accepted,\nNOTICE.\nNotice is hereby uiveii that II. W\nliowell is no longer in my employ nor\nconnected with my business in any man\nner whatever\nS. IWCKRR,\nAgent Singer Sewing Machines, Wai\nJulcu, Maui, tf.\nAUCTIONEER\nWAILUKU, : MAUI, T.
