Authoritative information\nstates the Czar desires juffc at\npresent to not end the war, and\nthis is due to the belief that Ad\nmiral Rodjestvensy may succeed\nin defeating Admiral Togo\'s fleet.\nA prominent diplomat said today:\n"I am informed the Czar consid\n| ers he would be guilty of commit\nting act if he did not take a final\nchance of regaining the Far East\nby ordering; matters could not be\nworse than now, while if he is\nvictorious it would change the\nwhole complexion of the cam\npaign." The^ Czar considers the\ni chance worth taking, but his res\nolutions change daily and no one\nin the world, least of all the Czar,\njean predict from his views one\nday what will be his attitude the\nnext.\nDispatches received from Man\nchuria indicate there may be a re\nsumption of hostilities in the near\nI future.\nA Harbin telegram states main\nJapanese army is within twenty\nfive miles of Russian outpost.\nJapanese proclamations have\n?\nreached Harbin stating that the\nMikado\'s, army intends to occupy\nHarbin about the middle of April.\nNo further news has been receiv\ned within the last twenty-four\nhours. In regard to reported wide\nturning movements of Japanese\ntoday, northwest and northeast,\nfears of military experts that\nthese movements, which would\npractically leave General Line\nvitch\'s army cut off and isolated\nfrom sources of supply, are actu\nally in progress, have not been al\nlayed by long silence.\nRussians in Distress.\nSpecial to The Oil Review.\nSt. Petersburg, March 30. ?\nIt is stated the value of war ma\nterials captured by the Japanese\nat Mukden w;is $2,000,000. Inter\nnatioanl troubles in Russia are in\ncreasing, and disorders continue\nin many quarters. A dspatch re\nceived today states a mob of peas\nants is looting estates of Princess\nJ use uh off, in Vononczh district. I\nCholera is spreading in Southern\nRussia, adding intense alarm to\ngeneral unrest. The strike situa-,\ntion in Riira district is not im-|\nproved.

The couple were mar\nried in Austria f<?ur years a so.\njMorkoitch came to America a\nyear ago. and his wife camo two\n[mouths ago. Since her arrival tin\nI husband had worried and quarrel\nled with wife almost constantly,\n{demanding, the police say, that\ni she support him by leading a life\nof shame, the woman objecting to\n; this mode of life. Last evening\n,Morkoiteh beat her severely with\n! a beer bottle, and the woman\nwaited until the husband was\nj sleeping and attacked him with a\nj sharp hatchet. The woman was\nnot molested, although several\nboarders oceupied the .same sleep- j\ning room with the couple.

Jacobs of New Martinsville,\nwas written to Attorney George C.\nBaker of Morgantown, yho has\nbeen contributing some interest\ning letters to the press on the sub\nject of taxing leaseholds, and\nwho has- taken up a vigorous\nfight against the Standard Oil\ncompany in th s State:\nHon. George C. Baker, Mor\ngantown, W. Va.:\nDear Sir: ? Your letter and\npublication have both been receiv\ned and considered. I can give\nyou mv opinion on the subject\ndiscussed by giving you the sub\nstance of an opinion which I pre\npared some ten years ago on the\nsubject of tlie Taxation of C a\nties Real," which I submit in con\ndensed form. * ?\nWhat is taxable m this otate\nas property: and what exempt.\nThe Constitution, Art. 10, Sec. 1,\nprovides "Taxation shall be equal\nand uniform throughout the State\nand all property, both real and\npersonal, shall be taxed in pro\nportion to its value to be ascer\ntained as directed by law.\nNo property is exempt except\nthat which is specifically men\ntioned in the Constitution. The\nLegislature has no power of ex\nemption or dispensation.\nAll property, therefore, except\nthat exempt by the Constitution\nmust bear its just share of the\npublic burdens of taxation. AMiat\ncharacter of property is the prop\nerty held under an ordinary oil\nand gas lease for a certain num\nber of years and as much longer\nas oil and gas are produced in\npaving quantities? An undevel\noped oil lease is a mere right to\nenter and search? a mere license\n? a mere choice.\nA developed lease stands on\nvastly different ground. When\nthe search has been successful\nand oil has been produced in pay\ning quantities the relation of land\nlord and tenant, immediately\narises The license is converted\ninto a leasehold and the estate be\ncomes a perfected leasehold; and\nthe property in the tenant or\nlessee is a chattel real. It is prop\nerty of some kind. It is not re\naltv: it is personality, and that\nkind of personalty which par\ntakes sufficiently of the character\nof realtv as to compel its legal\nclassification as ? ""battel real.\nIt can be nothing else. As a\n"chattel real\' it has value gi eat\ner or less. It is property, not, real\nbut personal ? a thing of value\noften of much value.\nI Are not therefore all the condi\ntions of taxation present: tho\nproperty; its character: its value?\nCan any officer in these circum\nstances obey his oath and let it\nescape?\nWhy not taxable? Tbe Consti\ntutional provision above cited\ncommands "all property, both\nI real and personal." to be taxed,\ni Chapter 29. section 48, of the\nCode, provides, speaking in rela\ntion to the listing and assessment\nof personal property, "all per\nsonal property belonging to per\nsons residing in this State, etc..\nand all personal property in the\nState though owned by persons re\ni siding out of the State, shall be\ni entered in the personal property\nhooks and be subject to equal and\nuniform taxation unless specifi\ncally exempt by law, etc."\nWe have not a law which enum\nerates specifically the articles to\nbe taxed, but a law which unequi\nvocally provides that "all per\nsonal property" shall be entered\nin the personal property books\nfor taxation.\nWe are, therefore, remitted to\nthe common law distinctions to\ndetermine whether producing\nleaseholds are taxable as person- j\nalty. A productive oil lease is a\n"chattel real;" there is no multi\nplying words about that matter:\nand a "chattel real" is personal:\nproperty; and when the Leigsla-J\nture provided that all personal j\nproperty shall be listed for taxa- 1\ntion, equal and uniform, there isJ\nno room for cavil ? chattels real\nare as certainly within the letter\nand the spirit of the law as eat- 1\ntie. horses or sheep; and just as\nliable to taxation as bonds, bills\nor notes, which are only represen\ntatives of value.\nj Whether a bond, or a producing j\noil lease is of value or not. or\nwhether its value is easy or diffi\ncult of ascertainment or compu-j\ntation. does not enter into the con\nsideration.\n[The bond may be worth fifty ,\ncents on the dollar; the oil lease\nmay be less valuable than its|\nowner anticipated; yet they both\npossess value: else why so tena\nciously held to?\n01 leaseholds equally with\nbonds, notes or ? deeds represent\nvalues. If the fee in land repre\nsented by the deed is taxable, why\nnot that thing less than the feo\nrepresented by Ihe lease be the.\n?subject of taxation?\nPersonal property of all kinds\'\nis taxable because it is valuable.\nIf the lessee or tenant is taxed\non his term and also on his other\nproperty, he is in the same plight\nas the farmer who is taxed on his\nfee and also on his personalty.\nThe plan works 110 discrimination\nnor hardship.\nThe practical question is not to j\ndetermine what is taxable, but to\ndetermine a basis of value fori\nequal and uniform taxation. This:\nis a matter of detail alone. |\nWe tax values. "The name of\nthe property is a matter of little |\nconcern; of minor importance; it I\nis only a matter of convenience:\nthe primary idea is to get prop\nerty values properly 011 the tax\nbooks; it being of secondary mo\nment whether it is there desig\nnated > by technically accurate\nnames or not.\nA fairly certain designation\nsufficient to differentiate the prop\nerty taxed is all that is required.\nThe essential thing to do is to as\nsess the thing of which value is\npredicated, call it what we may;\nvet it should be named with suf\nficient accuracy to furnish a des\nignation.\nIf T were listing and assessing\nleaseholds as chattels real for the\npurposes of taxation, to be strict\nly correct. 1 should designate on\nthe personal property books such\ninterests as a "certain chattel real\nI ? leasehold of A. B. on 100 acres\n! with 20 producing oil wells, val\nued at $25,000," by way of illus\ntration. And I should feel con\nTHIS SPACE RESERVED FOR\nW. E. ALLEN & CO.\n519 WELLS STREET.\nfident I should be within the lim\nits of the law. Producing lease\nholds are of value.\nThey are properly assessable <\nannually and this prevents any in\njustice arising out of diminished\nproduction. They have a well as\ncertained value and ought to be\nassessed. Millions escape taxation\non account of failure of officers\nto do their plain duty.\nI am surely of opinion that a\nproductive oil lease is a " chattel\nreal/\' and as such, personal prop\nerty, a thing of value, easily as\ncertained and ascertainable, and\nliable to assessment.\nSuch, in brief, is mv opinion\nformed years ago, and I therefore\nconcur in your views. The Legis\nlature might have given some ex\npression on the subject, but as the\nlaw now is it amply provides for\nthe taxation of this character of\nproperty. Yours truly,\nTHOS. P.

At\nthat time it was supposed that\nthere would be something doing\nin the oil business in that vicinity\nand the supposition has proven\ncorrect.\nThe building of the tank was\nfor the purpose of freezing out the\nNational Pipe Line company^ and\nsteps to that end have and are\nbeing taken.\nThe tank is called the property\nof the Vacuum Oil company, but\nit is believed and is almost an as\nsured fact that the company back\nof the enterprise is the all-power\nful Standard Oil company in dis- \'\nguise.\nThe National Pipe 1/ine com\npany, a home institution, has been\n! paying three cents per barrel\nJ above the Standard\'s price, and\n:the latter evidently did not like\nI lie business gotten by the former\nconcern and intend putting it to\nthe bad.\nThe Vacuum company has\nraised the price of the Standard\n! ten cents on the barrel, and is\n! making yearly contracts with the\nj producers at Gravel Itoink and the\nsurrounding fields. It has al\nready secured the fluid from one\nfarm at least, and will undoubt-|\nedly get more when it has com\npleted connections which will be\nI made in a short time.\nThe National will die game, if\nit dies at all, and has raised its\nprice three cents more on the bar\nrel than the Vacuum, which is\nthirteeen cents higher than the\nregular price of the Standard.\nThe local company will not make\ncontracts, but will endeavor to\ni weather the storm, and it is hoped j\n| by the people of Marietta that it\ncan do this.\nGravel Bank and surrounding i\nI fields produce great quantities of:\noil and the fight for the output\n| promises to be an interesting one j\nland the outcome will be watched\n| with great interest by the oil fra- j\nternitv find the people in general.\nTen to thirteen cents on the bnr-|\nrel means much to the producer, i\nand he will, for the most part, j\nsell where the most money is in j\nsight.\nH.

"No person\nfree of catarrh in my opinion was\never troubled with debility. So\nyou will readily understand that\nthe cure of debility depends en\ntirely on the cleaning out of the\ncatarrhal parasites. No debility\ncure will ever cure you as long as\nyou have catarrh. Catarrh is the\ncause. Debility is the result.\nThen you get rid of the cause. No\nremedy will ever cure you but a\ncatarrh remedy, and no other\'\nremedy will do it but Rexnll Mu-j\ncu-Tone. I make this statement\nbecause we know what Mucu\nlone is and what it will do ? and\ndoesn t it stand to reason that a\nremedy designed for one partic\nular purpose ? as Mucu-Tone for\noatarrli only ? is going to give re\nsults a hundred times better than\na cure-all that aims at every dis\nease in the dictionary?
