Thanks, to the excellent organization and, community relations of the Havana, Jewish “Patronato,” anti-Semitism, is not a factor locally., The world feared the Cuban, chaos fraught with danger to the, small and vunerable Jewish com, munity of 12,000. In the first few, bloody days while the 26th of July, Movement consolidated its hold in, Havana, shops owned by Jews, were damaged or looted. But so, were many non-Jewish businesses., Actually the lifting of martial law, permitted a study which showed, damaged much less than originally, feared., INDIVIDUALS reported the situ, ation at one point reminiscent of, the 1917 turbulence in Moscow. But, merchants who suffered losses, agreed that the looting was not, motivated by anti-Semitism. It was, only the exploitation of the strife, by criminal elements., The Castro forces showed no, Group To Study, School Expansion, A Beth Hebrew Congregation, committee will be formed to con, sider expansion of religious school, facilities to meet an expected in, crease in enrollment, it was an, nounced by Harry J. Weiss, con, gregation president., The congregation’s board recent, ly named the school the Rabbi, Abraham Lincoln Krohn Religious, School in recognition to the import, ant role the late Rabbi A. L.

Wall of Burlington, Vt., will launch a lecture series, sponsored by the Beth El Congregation and Temple Beth Israel, Men’s Clubs at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday at Beth El Auditorium., A musicale will be presented by Cantor Harold L. Green. The, rabbi will speak on “Prayer In Personal Life.”, Rabbi Armond Cohen of Cleveland will discuss “Ritual In Modern, Life” in an 8 p.m. lecture Feb. 15 at Temple Beth Israel. The talk, will be preceded by a musicale by Cantor Maurice P. Chesler., Concluding the series at 8:30 p.m. March 18 at Temple Beth Is, rael will be Rabbi Stanley Rabinowitz of Minneapolis with a talk on, “Unity and Diversity in Judaism.”, Tickets for the series, at $2 each, are available at the Beth El and, Beth Israel offices and at the Jewish Community Center., The programs are designed to enrich the community’s understand, ing of Jewish spiritual life and culture and to provide a closer bond, between the two men’s groups., immediate measures were taken to, protect Jews and all other Cubans, except Dictator Batista’s hench, men., Police and organized authority, were absent from the streets for, several days. The mob wrecked, gambling casinos and otherwise, vented its wrath against the Ba, tista regime and the foreign,, ostentatious influences it imported., But Havana Jewry is so totally ac, cepted there is no record of any, rabble rouser injecting anti-Semi, tism., THE RURAL FORCES compris, ing the cadre of the Castro army, were remarkably polite and discip, lined. They were bearded like Bibli, cal prophets and looked much like, the Haganah of pre-independence, Israel. Indeed, a few were Sep, hardic Jews from Santiago who, proudly wore the Mezzuzah., The student body of the Univer, sity of Havana includes several, hundred Jewish youths who share, the 26th of July philosophy. Max, Lesnick, whose father is Jewish, is, leader of the Castro youth move, ment., The main institution which lias, built Judaism and brotherhood in, Cuba is the “Patronato” the, “House of Jewish Community of, Cuba.” Located in a beautiful, building, it houses Jewish cultural,, social, and religious activities in, cluding a magnificent Orthodox, synagogue. It is a virile institution, and has attracted the favorable, comment of the general Cuban, press. f, , AS MANY AS 400 or 500 persons, attend Oneg Shabbat services on, Friday evenings. Jewish tourists, are welcomed in what General Sec, retary Isaac Gurwitz describes as a, sort of “missionary” activity to, provide Judaism to Jewish visitors, to Havana. Gurwitz is typical of the, high calibre of the center’s leader, ship., The center is conscious of the is, olation of Cuban Jewry as a bit, of the Yishuv in a small and vola, tile Spanish-speaking republic. To, day the center is recognized wide, ly as representative of the respect, ed Jewish community., Gurwitz has pointed out that the, Jews of Cuba know less than non-, Jewish Cuban intellectuals about, the important role of Jews in Cu, ban history. Jews arrived in Cuba, with Columbus, promoted sugar,, the island’s most important'export,, and were among the close friends, and lieutenants of Cuban patriot, Jose Marti., THE JEWISH community in Cu, ba is such that the Cuban Senate, was among the first to officially, recognize the Balfour Declaration, on Jewish rights in Palestine. , Cuba, has friendly commercial and pol, itical relations with Israel and their, continuation is anticipated under, the new government., The “Patronato” is proud of its, central role in Cuban Jewish life., It is not only perpetuating but re, generating Judaism in Cuba. The, building is better equipped and, more active than Jewish centers, in United States cities boasting, Jewish communities many times, thfc size of Cuban community., Jews take special pleasure in the, fact that the building, erected re, cently, was designed by Cuba’s, great architect, Professor Achilles, Capablanca. He is a non-Jew whose, visionary concepts are recognized, throughout the world. He visited, many Jewish centers in the United, States while planning the Havana, structure because of his desire that, Cuban Jewry have a building, worthy of its status and dignity,, evidence of Communism. When, Castro’s patrols took over Havana,, Entered aa second class matter, under the act of March 3, 1879, Combined Quota, Tops $320,000, On the eve of the Jan. 20 launching of the 1959 United, Jewish Welfare Fund campaign, the Phoenix Jewish Com, munity Council board of directors has confirmed a $195,-, 000 campaign goal recommended by its budget committee, plus an additional $125,200 for the United Jewish Appeal, Special Fund. 1, The unprecedented goal was determined after consider, ation of local, national, and overseas needs and a report, on the needs in Israel for a special fund to consolidate and, rehabilitate immigrants and to provide transportation for, Rumanian and possibly Russian,, Jews who will be permitted to, leave their Iron-Curtain countries, in 1959., INFORMATION regarding the, new immigration possibilities were, reported by Harold Alpert, coun, cil president, who recently returned, from a UJA national conference in, New York City., A campaign cabinet has been or, ganized by Campaign Chairman, Phil Taxman which includes the, leadership of six men’s divisions,, six women’s division under the, chairmanship of Mrs. Dasha Todd,, four special synagogue divisions co, chairmanned by Rabbis William, Greenberg, Albert Plotkin, and, Carol Klein; two miscellaneous, divisions operated by the council, office staff, and participation from, all council member organizations., “FAIR SHARE” letters, suggest, ing amount of gift, are being sent, to Jewish community members., Cumulative lists of givers will ap, pear periodically in the Phoenix, Jewish News in categories of gifts., The newspaper will be mailed to, all members of the Jewish commu, nity during the campaign to keep, them informed on campaign prog, ress., The traditional campaign kickoff, dinner will be held at the Arizona, Biltmore Hotel under leadership of, Taxman, Harry Rosenzweig, Max, well Klein, Alpert, and Sam Fine, berg., AS*IN 1957 and 1958, a yearbook, will be published during the latter, part of 1959 which will contain re, ports of community progress for, the year and lists of givers and, their 1959 contributions., Said Taxman of the new drive:, “It is true that Phoenix has done, a good job during the past few, years in the Welfare Fund. But it, is time now that we grew up and, faced the realities. We raise far too, little here to support our agencies, adequately., “If we want institutions and serv, ices that we can be proud of, that, are capable of meeting the needs, of people, we must support them, better., “IT IS NOT just a matter of, pride that should prompt us to, raise more money but urgent ne, cessity. This is not a town of ‘poor, folks'. Many of us live on a grand, scale in luxurious homes, denying, ourselves nothing of the finer, things. Let’s give the way we live., If we do, we will raise more than, our goal., “There is no finer feeling in the, world than the one that comes with, giving adequately and proportion, ately.”, READERS NOTICE, i Everyone in the Phoenix Jewish Community will, : ceive this and the next few issues of the Phoe, : nix Jewish News.

OH., January 16, 1959, fines of the Jewish world. His vast, store of knowledge dealing with, world events and how they affected, the Jew has a very important bear, ing upon the development of Jew, ish history., He makes us realize one signifi, cant fact: that the Jew lives in a, greater civilization than his own., What happens on the outside af, fects us Jews on the inside, and, we are inevitably bound up with, all the movements of history. We, react to them negatively or posi, tively, but w e do not remain iso, lated. We are part of the main, stream of the world’s civilization,, and we play our role even as we, have molded a great deal of the, forces that have gone into the de, velopment of history., As we open the book which is, mammoth in size and in scope, a, 600-page saga of modern Jewish, life, we are aware of how early we, come onto the modem world, scene. It was only a few hundred, years ago that we were locked up, in a background ghetto. We were, forced to live in the most degrad, ing and humiliating of circum, stances., EVERY JEW had a number, and, every Jew paid a body tax to the, government for his very existence., He was compelled to wear a yellow, badge to identify him. He could, occupy himself in a few degrading, professions, and these he ,had to, render every account for before, the government. On his head was, the badge of shame, the constant, reminder that he was a “Christ, killer.” But the Jew was not des, tined to remain behind the chains, and the wall of isolation., The French Revolution was a, great step for the emancipation of, the Jew. The Jew for the first, time became a citizen of France,, and all disabilities were taken, away. However, there was a price, the Jew had to pay—a price for, which he has suffered from ever, since that day that Napoleon called, together a “Sanhedrin.” There 70, rabbis and laymen, locked behind, solid doors and guarded by sol, diers, were forced to say they were, Jews by religion only and made to, separate themselves from the cul, ture and historic consciousness of, a people., The Jews hoped that by severing, themselves from a people they, would become an integrated part, of that country’s well-being. This, became the pattern for Jews, throughout Western Europe. This, caused a division between the Jew, of the West and the Jew of the, East. Unfortunately, the Jew of, the East never was granted citizen, ship and suffered every disability, of the ghetto., ANTI - SEMTTISM in Europe, broke out with the famous trial of, Captain Dreyfuss. At this trial Dr., Theodore Herzl, a noted Viennese, journalist, saw the tragedy of mod, ern European Jewry.

He saw a tragedy of a, people caught in the strain of a, new weapon that ultimately would, destroy them. In the creation of, Zionism and the ideal of the Jew, ish state, Herzl’s spirit burned with, the zeal., „ This is the way Jewish history, works. When darkness blots out, one period, the light goes on in the, other. At the time when the doors, closed on Europe, the light came, through in America and in Pales, tine. Here ,has come the develop, ment of two new Jewries in which, history has placed a new responsi, bility—the Jewry of America which, has its hand in formulating a new, Jewish culture and the State of Is, rael, which came into being after, great heartbreak and suffering., TODAY THEY are like the two, supporting hand of Moses on either, side of that historic plaque., What will our role be, and what, will be our position in the years to, come? The great enthusiasm to go, forward will never cease. In each, of us that power is given, and we, shall write future chapters, and, they shall not be chapters of dark, ness and persecution, but of light, and of triumph., REGISTRATION, IS SUSPENDED, JERUSALEM (JTA)— Regulations, concerning the registration of Is, raeli citizens and residents have, been cancelled temporarily pending, conclusion of an international smr, vey of rabbis and Jewish scholars, for their opinions of how to handle, questions of registration of the chil, dren of mixed marriages, Premier, David Ben Gurion told his cabinet., As a result, he continued, the, government will not accept appli, cations for reconsideration of reg, istration classification made ear, lier in the case of children of mixed, marriages., This first authoritative statement, on the subject since the National, Religious Party quit the cabinet, over the issue, is expected to cool, tempers for the next few months., It is also expected to take the wind, out of the sails of the opposition,, which has called for a Parliament, ary debate on the appointment of, Rabbi Jacob M.

The pro, perty includes extensive farm hold, ings in West Germany., The ministry reported that, legacies to the State of Israel from, abroad during the past year total, led more than 1,000,000 Israeli, pounds., NEW YORK PASTRAMI, Hot, Lean, Sliced to Your Order, sl4s*., Buy As Much or As Little As You Wish, VISIT OUR DOWNTOWN STORE, 127 No. Ist Ave AL 3-9943, ,onion *2tf nionn, -mx *7® nnion 1*2121 *2?, n*2B 1*22 .n*2inn, ,nV*?ioi?r nrv*? 9-2, oixn ]» n*22Htf noixn, nni-o nnisn xn itisagi, nio?*? rrn? ntfoxi ,*?*nttra, •qwoo won nixsin *22 nx, T m, mi-sai n*2inn oix, : vv t t :, .ynxn *pao x*2 ,noon jo, nysatf ,*2X“ifcr*2 n»;j?n jnj?n, nyxtfn nx, }X3 .1720-0-11027*2 |op r notf, noixrn nn o»j?nn*2 loni, niTx nx iroxtf ,onn3n, -nmotf*? anon .n*2inn, -:•• t • t, -nichn noo & i73on, :\\t:•• - v -, ixtfn xm, .0*21730® D3X*2 nnoroo, (nu?2iy n*sua), THE LAKE THAT DISAPPEARED, Several years ago when someone mentioned the Hule district we, used to think of a place of swamps, malaria mosquitoes and wild ani, mals, and of a dream of a gigantic development project., This year the dream has become a reality, and when (we) speak, now of the Hule we mean an area of over 30,000 acres of fertile land, on the northeastern border of Israel. In this area tractors today plow, fields kilometres in length, and stalks of corn grow to a height of three, metres, The draining of the Hule took about 20 years. At first at a very slow, pace, and since the establishment of the state at a more rapid pace,, despite the numerous disturbances of the Syrians who are located on, the eastern border of the Hule district. The entire project cost about, 9 000 000 Israeli pounds, but the land which was rescued from the lake, and the swamps is the most fertile in Israel and it will be possible to, cover the drainage costs in the course of a short time., Lake Hule and its swamps have disappeared from the map, but not, from the landscape of the country. The Jewish National Fund, which, carried out the gigantic project, left a small area as a nature reserve, Here the rare fauna and flora which characterized the Hule district will, continue to exist. There are already eucalyptus groves surrounding the, nature reserve and it will remain as a memento to the lake that dis, appeared.

The issues we face demanding the raising of larger sums are the same issues that con, front Jews in every organized community in the free world., During 1959 all of us, Jews in Phoenix and everywhere, must }oin together in the heroic task of, supporting vital Jewish services at home and abroad; of rescuing our persecuted brothers where, ever they may be; of lifting the hearts of the immigrants in the U. S. and in Israel. Every Jew must, help in the task., We have been assigned the sum of $195,000 to raise in the Regular Welfare Fund Campaign, and $125,200 to raise in the United Jewish Appeal Special Fund for Rescue & Rehabilitation. This, total of $320,200 must be raised by apportioning to each of our givers his FAIR SHARE. I have seen, many of our larger givers and am pleased to report that every man I have seen has promised his, FAIR SHARE for 1959!, No household in the Jewish Community is exempt from giving and working. The United Jew, ish Welfare Fund is our UNITED way of meeting Jewish responsibilities. The UJWF is a first priority, "must" for every moral Jew. We can save lives, teach children and defend our good name with, money and work. There are no substitutes., Look over the list of our beneficiaries. Let their names impress you with their worthwhileness., Pay your respects to the people who have enlisted in positions of leadership and help them to, achieve our goal. When you are called upon to give do so gladly, generously, proportionately. There, is no LIVING without GIVING!

Our listeners may remem, ber the increase in Israeli activi, ties along the Syrian border during, Henderson’s visit last summer,, when the United States attempted, to strangle Syria., “YOU MUST remember alse how, Israel publicly threatened Jordan, at the time when the American and, British occupiers had to withdraw, from Arab territory. The Israeli, militarists at that time were try, ing to assist the West in their ef, forts to postpone the withdrawal, of the American and British forces, from Lebanon and Jordan., “Bearing aU this in mind, one, may be surprised at the new cam, paign of threats by Israel which is, being launched at the very same, time the U.S. authorities and the, U.S. press are shouting loudly, about a so-called improvement in, relations between the United States, and the United Arab Republic., This surprise soon disappears, knowing that United States, with, deceiving smiles to the Arabs,, seeks to destroy Arab unity. At the, same time, it is pursuing a policy, of force., “WASHINGTON has concluded, bilateral military treaties with the, neighbors of the Arabs Turkey,, Iran and Pakistan—in the hope of, surrounding the Arabs with its al, lies. Is it not true that Washington, is encouraging Israel now in the, hope that the Arabs, who, under, pressure brought to bear on them, from all sides, may be forced to, change their conduct toward the, United States., “Now that the U. S. authorities, are pretending friendship with the, Arabs, the Israeli leaders have, started to criticize the West, at the, orders of the United States. It is, pointed out that if Israel attach, the United States and other West, ern powers, the Arabs would easily, believe the American claims about, so-called friendship, and thus, would fall in the trap of American, intrigues., “MOSHE DAYAN, the former, commander of the Israeli army,, was the first to speak so seriously, that it makes one laugh. He said, that the honeymoon which brought, Israel and the West together might, be short. The falsehood of this, statement is obvious from the fact, that Israel cannot live without the, financial aid of the West, and pri, marily the United States., “High officials of the Israeli For, eign Ministry furthered this farce,, which they are acting out in U.S., interests, at a recent meeting., These officials pointed out while, unable to contrel their laughter, Washington was committing an er, ror in making advances toward the, United Arab Republic. Neverthe, less, the fact remains that the tem, porary U.S. demarche toward the, Arabs pleases the Israeli states, men, who hope to restrain the, hands of the Arabs in all important, questions through the United, States.”, Sam Shapiro Subject, Os Magazine Article, Sam Shapiro and his Southwest, ern scrap metal operations were, the subject of an article by Jo, seph Stocker in the Arizona Days, and Ways Magazine, supplement to, the Jan. 11 Arizona Republic., Shapiro, a leading figure in Phoe, nix Jewish community organiza, tions and charity work, is presi, dent of National Metals Co., Jewish Baking . . ., Pumpernickel Cholla Bread, Cakes Pastries Cookies, All baking under the supervision of, ABE HOLTZMAN, That good old fashioned Jewish Rye Bread, and a complete line of bakery goods, made the way you like it., Nosh O 1 Rye Bake Shop, 1625 N. 7th St. Phone AL 3-3572, Owners: Abe Holtzman & Miracle Mile Restaurant, Miracle Mile Delicatessen, and Restaurant, "THE VERY BEST, IN KOSHER STYLE FOOD", 1521 E.

(Deuteronomy. 12:21}, From this verse in the Torah comes all of the detailed regulations governing the practice of, Shehitah. For over 2000 years these regulations have been treated in the Talmud, the Mishna Tor, ah of Maimonides, and tne Shulhan Aruch, and all in all in every land where Jews have lived and, live today, have guided the Shoctim—the cattle and poultry slaughterers—in the performance of, their duty., In 1565, Rabbi Joseph Caro, a great scholar of his time, wrote the Shulan Aruch (literally, The, Prepared Table). This book was prepared as a convenient laymen\'s guide to Judaic traditional, practices. Today the Shulhan Aruch with which every member of the Jewish faith is more or less, familiar, has become the supreme and final authority on tradition and practices., The portions of the works of Maimonides and Caro, detail and spell out the rules of Shehitah and, Kashruth from the regulations for the killing of food animals by a trained Shocet, down to the, compulsory observances in the home before the cut of meat or poultry may be cooked and eaten, —the kosnering of the meat or fowl by salting, soaking, washing and placing it on a tilted board, to further drain the last possible drop of blood., The practice of Shehitah according to the regulations of orthodox Judaism brought into ex, istence the first practical sanitary meat inspection procedure in history, and it was to be almost, twenty centuries before our own United States caught up to it with the passage of the Federal, Meat Inspection Act fifty years ago, and the Federal Poultry Inspection Act only recently., For the rules of Shehitah demand that the Shochet, in addition to being a pious Jew versed, in the laws pertaining to his office and possessing the manual skill and dexterity to properly exe, cute his duties, must also be a person well qualified by training, knowledge and practice., The student slaughterer must successfully pass a rigid examination, called Bedikah (literally: in, ritual law—an investigation) before a Board of competent judges versed in both the law and the, practice of Shehitah, generally a rabbinical board. The candidate must demonstrate both his, knowledge and proficiency, and if successful, he receives a Kabbalah, which is both a certificate, of proficiency and the permission to practice Shehitah. The Kabbalah, however, is not a perman, ent license. The Shochet may be re-examined at any time to see if he retains his knowledge and, skill., Judaic law rules that the Shochet must not only know the correct slaughtering technique for, each animal, but must also know how to apply his skills in as humane a manner as possible. This, calls for a correctly administered killing stroke by means of the different Chalafim, the tradition, al razor edged unnicked knives prescribed for the various animals. The Shochet\'s stroke must kill, quickly and easily, so that the blood flows rapidly out of the body and the animal expires as pain, lessly as possible. Any deviation from the strictly prescribed procedure in the slaughtering of the, animal is sufficient to render the carcass T\'refah., It is interesting to note that nearly all of the forbidden deviations from the prescribed slaugh, tering procedures are likely to cause the animal being killed unnecessary pain and in this connec, tion we find that the word T\'refah in the ancient language of the Israelite tribes originally meant, "something tom by a wild animal", in other words, painfully killed., Whether slaughtering is a more important part of a Shochet\'s work than another is difficult to, conclude, but from a modern and practical point of view, the Jewish housewife of today feels, that the inspection of the carcass is vital. Tne Shochet must also have the basic veterinary know, ledge to recognize the signs of animal disease in the organs of the animal he has slaughtered, and, he must be proficient in making a post-mortem examination of the vita! organs for signs of disease, —the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, intestines, etc. For this examination there is a very strict proced, ure in the laws pertaining to Shehitah., Post-mortem examination of the vital organs of slaughtered meat animals is one of the basic, laws of our Federal Meat Inspection Regulation. In these, medical science and Judaic religious, practices, have come together as perhaps in ni other instance in +h«, (This is the second of a series of articles on the Kosher meat industry in the U.S. Watch for the next, one in the following issue of the Phoenix Jewish News.), It will be our aim to give the Jewish housewife fie best selection of meat and poultry at reason, able prices.

Under her direction, the, pre-school program has steadily broadened its base, and expanded enrollment while maintaining high, standards of operation., No matter what situations forced their resignations,, they are deserving of tribute for their accomplishments, which have so greatly benefitted the community., There is no doubt that differences with center of, ficials figured in their resignations. These have not, been made public and there is no way to judge the, rights and wrongs of the situation., However, it seems that the center brasshats brought, things to a head at a most inopportune time. Such, changes are more properly brought about at the end, of an activity period, such as in May or early June., Not only are the personnel in a better position to ac, quire posts commensurate with their ability then, but, such temperance avoids overloading the center staff, during the vital United Jewish Welfare Fund cam, paign., The UJWF drive has been severely weakened. In, stead of being able to devote his full energies to the, campaign, the center’s executive director finds his ef, fectiveness hamstrung by a myriad of commonplace de, tails which he now has to handle personally., And both he and center officers are further bound, by the requirement to hunt out potential successors, to Bennett, to schedule and conduct interviews with, applicants, and to hold meetings to determine which, applicant is most suitable., It would behoove the center to decide on its per, sonnel for a full year at a time and then live up to its, decision., Education, Series Slated, At Beth Israel, A Temple Beth Israel education, series on “What Is a Jew?" will, be conducted on six successive, Thursdays beginning next week.

N. Relief and, Works Agency would “continue to, exist until we find a solution to the, refugee problem.”, This statement was hardly cal, culated to encourage Arab accept, ance of new solutions to the prob, lem, And yet this is preoisely what, Hammerskjold ought to be doing., For the work of UNRWA is sched, uled to end in 1960. It has been an, expensive and un, ■ productive opera, tion, for it has si, simply kept the, refugees alive but, has not given, them the will to, find useful work,, nor helped them, in new homes., Its existence, has encouraged, the effort of Arab, Debbie Metz lead f to pre, vent the resettle, ment of the refugees and their, chance for a new life., NOW THE U.N., at the insist, ence of the Western Nations, is, seeking a solution which will not, perpetuate UNRWA but which will, give to the refugees the dignity and, usefulness and hope which they, have not known in 10 years., Their leaders do not wish to co, operate in such a solution, but, Hammerskjold is committed by his, own promise to the U.N- to find, ways and means of achieving it., Therefore, he is unwise to reas, sure the Arab leaders yet again ol, his devotion to the maintenance of, the status quo; 1960—and a reckon, ing by the U.N.—is not too far, away., * * *, COLLEGE GRADUATES inter, ested in a social work career will, be glad to know that a new merit, fellowship is available in their chos, en field., It is to be awarded by the Na, tional Jewish Welfare Board to, anyone with graduate status who, is interested in group work in a, Jewish community center or Y.M., H.

Eson has a word of advice., Dr. Eson, chairman of the psy, chology department at Albany, State College, addressed the New, York State Jewish Youth Confer, ence in Albany several weeks ago., Having just returned from a, nine-month stay in Israel under a, Fulbright grant, he was able, to, describe some differences he saw, in the young people of Israel and, those of the United States., The former, he said rather sur, prisingly, are more conforming, than American youth. But, he said,, “conformity is not the issue . . ., The problem is that young people, in the United States tend to con, form to the wrong values.’’, Expressing the opinion that our, dtHhiicioitf, / food ready j, W U TAKE OUT di*iy, JP^MEXiCAN, * RESTAURANT, \'7RULY A LITTLE CORNER, OF OLD MEXICO", SPfCIAU2!NG*iN TAKE OUT, ORDERS, WITH TRUE MEXICAN, , HOSPITALITY, *, DDIiKC XOC¥ *V*iUßte, fO# CWBS A parties, 3008 E.

Par, ents may quote him freely., * * *, IN LA PAZ, Bolivia, the Jewish, community is rejoicing., The 3,000-member community is, proud of an award recently re, ceived by its day school, the Jew, ish College of Bolivia., Rabbi G.
