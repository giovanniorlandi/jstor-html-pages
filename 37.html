        <pre>['ONTPELIER EXAMINER\nNO. 51\nMONTPELIER, IDAHO, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1904.\n: vol. ix.\nSOME THINGS ARE CERTAIN.\nThe appointme-nt of H. Smith Wooley, as U. S. assayer\nat Boise, seems to demonstrate a few things at least. One\nof these is that, he proWbly would have never received the\njob had he Qot been backed by his father-ih-law\'s powerful\ninfluence. There is no discounting that fact that Pres*\n&\nBudge is one of the pillars of the republican party in th\'s\nstate, in fact he has very nearly demonstrated, that he has\nI the party wrapped up in a small parcel and carefully tuck(d\naway in his pocket.\nAnother thing is evident, and that is that a new element\nhas come into power in the republican ranks in Idaho. The\nsoutheastern counties are dictating the policy of the part)\',\nand these counties contain most of the Mormon voters of the\n! state. They all seem to be solidly republican, and the party\nI cannot do without their support, hence it is that Heyburn,\nI Standrod and others, who expect\'political honors, are cater\n1 ing to this section and doing what the leaders of these counties\nI desire. The republicans for years, have endeavored to. get\ntins support, and now that they have it, tne support is\nmapping out the path the party must follow, irrespective of\nthe kicks from other sections of the state. The sugar boun\nI ty law came as a result of this- Likewise these counties\nhave a large slice of the State officials due to these same in\ni! fluences. And so it goes\nIt is a bitter dose for some of the old standby leaders of\nthe party, but they have got to swallow if they want the\nparty to stay in power in this state. It is indeed pathetic,\n►-Wert have fought the parties battles for years, And now\nwhen victory is won, that they must stand aside, while\nyoung men,scarcely known outside their immediate families,\ncome forward and snatch the rich federal and other office\nj\n\'\nSr\nplums.\nHow long will the old\nThe question naturally occurs:\ntimers stand the gaff?\nW\nThe democrats, the coming fall, are going to be placed\npeculiar predicament in this state. The republicans are\nsplit wide open on Mormon dominition of the party, and it\nnow looks as though a great element in that party will bolt\nthe ticket if Heyburn, Gooding, Htandrod, Budge, Wooley,\nand their friends control the convention and nominate the\ntiod of running an anti-Mormon campaign, thus hoping to\nwin, with the aid of the bolting republicans. Other strong\ndemocrats will oppose this procedure with all their might,\nand those of the Mormon faith may bolt the ticket if the\nDubois program is carried out. It is up to the democratic\nleaders to outline a plan and nominate a ticket, that shall\nnot be tainted with auti-Mormonism and yet will command\nin a\nticket, and this the latter will do it is certain. What are\nthe democrats going to do? Senator Dubois and his follow\nwould, it seems, like to place the democrats in the posi\ners\n, , . ... , . ,\nthe support of the bolting republicans. It\'s a big task, but\nwe believe it can be accomplished.\nWe will bet Teddy won\'t welcome any more western re\npublican senators, if they are going to bring along any as&iy\noffice tangles, such as Heyburn carried to Washington in his\nHowever, he couldn\'t dodge this one, for Heyburn,\ngrip.\nStandrod, French, Budge, et. al., will be powerful busy about\nthe time delegates are elected to the national republican\nconvention, and further, there is no telling but what Idaho s\nsix votes may come in pretty handy at Chicago in June.\n\\\nThe Colt Exhibition.\nthe\nChief Devine, of Salt Lake,\never saw together in one bunch."\nThat\'s the verdict of the judge who\npassed upon the colts exhibited in\nMontpelier last Friday. There were\n„ ._„j .\nsome twenty-five entered m the com-,\n•\'The finest lot of colts,\nsaid\n"that I\npetition, and there was not a scrub\nin the lot.

The\ndoctor eveu went so far as to offer\nto send his photograph to this paper\nfor publication, in order to empha\nsize his open candidacy, and talked\nit over ft-eely with leading members\nof the party here whose word on the\nsubject could not be questioned. It\nseems that Steely has a way of back\ning and filling an<I playing hide and\nseek with the politicians that sug\ngests tbe leading characteristics of\nthe present executive.

They had to\nmake the hardest fight of their lives\nto land the appointment of Wooley.\nThey found it rather serious opera\nbouffe, aud they have equally serious\nwork ahead to keep tbeir methods\ncovered up from public inspection,\nThere are a good many people who\nrealize that the senator is very much\ngiven to opera bouffe performances,\nSuch incidents as the palming off of\nthe home of another as that of the\nsenator during the visit of the presi\ndent to this state have intensified\nthis feeling. When thç presidential\nparty reached Wallace, they were\nentertained by the senator in one of\ntbe fine homes of that place. Mem\nbers of tbe party, including the\nnewspaper correspondents, were per\nmitted to carry away the impression\nit was tbe home\' of tbe senator, and\npictures of it were published as the\nresidence of the Idaho member,\nThe publication of the picture of the\nsenator in a gallery of the "million\naires" of 9 the senate has also had\nsomething to do with fixing public\nopinion on the general subject.\nThese things are not «uprising to\nIdaho people who are well informed\nupon the characteristics of our sena\ntor, but it is not improbable that, if\nPresident Roosevelt knew how clev\ner the latter is upon the opera bouffe\nstage, he could not be deceived by\nhim so easily.—Statesman (Rep.)\n, ml\nThe sugar factory at Idaho Falls\nhas closed its run tor the season with\nan output of about 8,000,000 pounds.\nAt one cent a pound bounty the\nr mmuiy, me\namount authorized by the last legis\nlature for the first year, the sugar\ntrust will be entitled to draw from\nthe people of this state $80,00»!\nbounty.
