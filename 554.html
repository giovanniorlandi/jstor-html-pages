S., Kirkland in Leslie\'s., PROFIT SHARING IN FRANCE, Idea Is Mora Widely Held In That, Country Than Any Other Part, of the World., ( Profit sharing Is being widely dls, | cussed In England now. in connection, with the nation\'s war activities, and, much consideration Is being directed, to experience in France, where it has, been in operation for TO years. There, Is In France a society organized for, the purpose of promoting profit shar, ing. and this society has been recog, nized by the government as a "public, utility.", In the French profit-sharing plans, generally benefit funds are instituted, to provide for emergencies in the life, of the workers. Ordinarily workmen, do not receive their share of the profit, In cash, but in the form of a fund,, which roes to purchasing shares In the, business or to old-age pensions., There are various systems of profit, sharing in vogue In France. One of, these gives a percentage of the net, profits over the wages, the manage, ment, and the various benefit funds., Another bases the percentage on sales, or total business done. Still other, forms base the amount given the work, ers on the dividend rate, the amount, of capital, or as a bonus at the dis, cretion of the employer. Certain com, panies are able to share with their, workers any savings they may make, In the cost of producing goods., Airplane Flares., The announcement was recently, made by MaJ. Gen. C. C. Williams,, chief of ordnance, of the perfection, and the adoption by the army for, use In France of an airplane flare for, night bombing. According to Major, General Williams, the flare Is released, from a bombing plane by pulling a lev, er. As it drops the resistance offered, by the air sets the fuse mechanism In, operation. The result is the emission, of a powerful light of from 300,000 to, 400,000 candle power, which completely, Illuminates the terrain below. The, amount of light given Is equivalent to, that of a battery of from 150 to 175, street arc lamps or from 15,000 to 17,, 500 ordinary Incandescent lamp bulbs, such as are used in the home. As soon, as the tlare gets Into operation a huge, parachute, made of the best quality, silk, opens and holds the brilliant light, In suspension In the air for a sufficient, time to allow the aviator to select his, objective or target. The bombs then, follow., Buddy Needed It Worse Than Qerman., Shaving off u week\'s growth of, beard aud capturing Germans at tie, same time would seem a difficult twit, to most soldiers, but not so with, one, American doughboy who entered a, dugout Just west of Thlaucourt and, found that he had walked Into the, temporary home of a German aolonel, whose retreat to the rear hid been, cut off by the barrage., The- colonel was taking his dally, share.
