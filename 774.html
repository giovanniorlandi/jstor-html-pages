        <pre>['REVIEW\nStatistics—Volume I\nBy\nN. L. JOHNSON, M.Sc, Ph.D., A.I.A.\nand\nH. TETLEY, M.A., F.I.A.\n[Pp. xii+294. Cambridge University Press. Price 20s.]\nThis book breaks new ground in the field of official actuarial\nliterature and uses some new tools in so doing. In those almost\nfabulous inter-war years, many commodities may have been more\nplentiful than they are to-day, but the means of statistical enlightenment\nwere not conspicuous among them. The reviewer\nrecalls that, as a student, he felt that statistics would be a most\ninteresting subject if only he could learn what it was all about. No\nobstacles to such an end exist to-day. Impelled by the demands\nof war and taking advantage too of the fashion of the hour, the\nscience of statistics has extended its scope and vastly increased\nthe number of its practitioners. To meet their diverse needs, textbooks\nhave—one exaggerates but little—poured forth in recent\nyears, turning the pre-war trickle into a powerful stream.\nThe needs of non-mathematical beginners, of advanced students\nand of research workers have been well catered for in these recent\npublications. As has happened in other fields, there is, however,\na middle class whose interests have hitherto been somewhat ignored.\nBy this one refers to the class of students, including actuarial\nstudents, who are prepared to treat the subject of statistics seriously\nthough not to specialise, and who wish not merely to use but to\nunderstand its methods. To them Messrs. Johnson and Tetley\nhave particularly addressed themselves, with considerable success.\nTheir book is indeed sub-titled " An Intermediate Text-Book," and\nthey express in the preface the hope that " although this book is\nintended primarily for those studying for the statistical sections\nof the actuarial examinations, it will be found useful in a considerably\nwider field." The mathematical standard required of the reader\nis that of the advanced papers in the school-leaving examinations.\nBe it noted that the work is published under the authority of the\n', 'Review 311\nInstitute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries, and that Volume\nI is designed for students of Part I of the new examination syllabus\nof the Institute. The statistical content of that syllabus is of\ncourse different from that laid down by the Faculty, and it seems\nprobable that meantime, at any rate, Johnson and Tetley\'s Statistics\nwill not be added to the official list of reading for the Faculty\'s\nexaminations. A word of advice, then, to the interested student of\nthe Faculty: dip into this book by all means, for some parts of\nit will be helpful for your Part III examination; study it more\ndeeply, if you are attracted to the subject, but as a post-graduate\nexercise—assuredly post-graduate.\nThe serious writer of a text-book on modern statistics must make\ntwo strategic decisions; how and where to introduce probability\ntheory, and where and how to introduce tests of statistical\nhypotheses. With regard to the former, Johnson and Tetley\nfollow Professor M. G. Kendall\'s practice in his. Advanced Theory,\nand take it up about half-way through Volume I. Their treatment\nof probability is fresh and honest; yet whilst these qualities should\nbe saluted, the reader may be left wondering if complete success\nhas been achieved. The authors indicate the difficulties in applying\nto statistics that theory of probability which is based on the notion\nof " equally likely " cases, and which most students first encounter\nin connection with logically simple combinatorial problems; the\ncasting of dice, the drawing of balls from urns, and so on. They\npoint out next the barrenness, for the same purpose, of the sophisticated\nmathematical theories based on sets and their measure.\nThey discuss tersely, sympathetically but hardly comprehensibly,\nthe " Kollektiv " theory. They touch, in unprejudiced manner,\nupon the " subjective " theories of probability of Bayes, Jeffreys\nand Perks. Their preference is however for none of these, but for a\nfrequency theory based upon experiment. Its salient features are\nas follows. Suppose a set of N trials is performed, which results in\nn successes. If a great number of such sets, of N trials each, is\ncarned out under similar conditions, the several values of the\nrelative frequency of success (n/N) will tend to cluster about a\nparticular value. This statement is made more precise thus:\npositive numbers, p, a and β say, can be found such that 99 per cent.\nof this great number of sets of trials will give relative frequencies\nbetween and Now, assert the authors, let N increase\nwithout limit, and it will be found that a and β both tend to zero\nwhile p remains constant, at some value between 0 and 1. p is now\nlabelled " probability of success." " It will be found that . . . "\n', '312 Review\nis the authors\' claim, and a rather impressive claim it is. They state\nthat it is based upon experimental evidence, such as was adduced\nby J. E. Kerrich in a book referred to in the bibliography. But if\nthe reader is to accept the theory as one founded upon experiment,\nand not on the mere assertion of his mentors ; if he is to accept the\nanalogy which the authors draw with the classical theory of dynamics,\nwherein " . . . a few experimental results (are) summarised and\nidealised in Newton\'s Laws of Motion " ; then will he expect the\nexperiments to be reasonably conclusive, easy to visualise and\npreferably simple to repeat. One doubts, unfortunately, whether\nthis is so.\nThe foregoing definition of probability involves infinities in two\ndirections. The number N of trials in a set must increase without\nlimit, and the number of sets involved must be great. Passage to a\nlimit is a mathematical idea, difficult if not incapable of conclusive\nexperimental verification. (Can one show experimentally, one\nwonders, that converges for any but diverges for\nAgain, the definition asserts that the quantities a and β tend to\nzero. Tend in what manner ?—one asks. In the usual sense, or in\nthe " stochastic " sense described on page 197 ? Doubtless good\nanswers could be given to such questions, but the pity is that a few\nmore pages were not devoted to their fuller discussion. The chapter\nas a whole might thereby have avoided any trace of the superficial,\nand have presented a satisfying and logically convincing survey of\nthe theoretical foundations of statistics.\nSimilar comments are germane to Chapter 9, on statistical\nhypotheses. The essentials of the problem are brought out, the\narguments are reasonably clear so far as they go, but they do not\ngo far enough to ensure the reader\'s logical assent. In this respect,\nhowever, criticism is probably better deferred, since it is hinted that\nthe subject will be pursued in Volume II. Though the authors do\nnot commit themselves too deeply to any of the several theories of\ntesting hypotheses, it is the Neyman-Pearson system which appears\nmost strongly to influence their line of development. On more\ndetailed points, the discussion on significance levels is to be commended.\nAs in many other works, however, relatively little explana-\ntion is given of why a test is usually concerned with deviations equal\nto and greater than those observed. It is too common for students to\nbe fobbed off with the suggestion that no logical or statistical problem\nis involved here at all. A certain vagueness in discussing levels of\nsignificance is probably intentional, and the absence of adequate\n', 'Review 313\nremarks on the errors involved in accepting or rejecting a statistical\nhypothesis will doubtless be remedied in the second Volume, One\nhopes, too, to find therein a discussion of power functions—a concept\nwhich is of the greatest value in illuminating the subject of statistical\nhypotheses and tests.\nWe turn now to the more detailed contents of the book. Chapter 1\ndeals with " Essential features of statistical data." It discusses\nelementary problems of classification and homogeneity, and points\nthe need for developing tools for summarising a mass of observations.\nIt brings out, in fact, the need for a science of descriptive\nstatistics. The chapter concludes with a curious little series of\nhistorical paragraphs, which follows the practice of the Dictionary of\nNational Biography in including only the eminent dead.\nThe next three chapters develop admirably this subject of\ndescriptive statistics. The simpler techniques are first explained,\nsuch as dot diagrams, histograms and ogives. Methods of presentation\nwhich have recently become fashionable in semi-popular\nliterature, such as " pie " charts and population pyramids, are\nexemplified. The second chapter concludes with a brief discussion\nof index numbers, a welcome actuarial flavour being imparted by\nthe illustrations, which include the Registrar - General\'s comparative\nmortality figure and standardised mortality ratio, and the\nActuaries\' Investment Index. The third chapter introduces the\nanalytical methods of descriptive statistics. Here Johnson and\nTetley avoid a pitfall which has tripped many writers of elementary\ntexts. They do not present a series of indices—arithmetic mean,\ngeometric mean, median, and the rest—as so many disconnected and\narbitrary quantities, leaving the reader to puzzle over their relative\nmerits. Rather do they start by explaining the general notion of,\nand need for, a measure of central tendency. They go on to state\nthe properties which every such useful measure should possess.\nThey then exemplify the commoner measures, and finally compare\ntheir respective advantages in elementary terms. A similar procedure\nis adopted for measures of dispersion. The chapter goes on to\ndescribe briefly the more elaborate indices of moments, skewness\nand kurtosis. The usual and indeed inevitable paragraphs on\ncomputational procedure, corrections for grouping and the formulae\nfor transforming moments about one point to those about another\npoint are not ignored. Chapter 4 elaborates the theme of descriptive\nstatistics in a more complex setting—that of pairs of variables. As\nin the preceding pages on univariate problems, the graphical approach\nis first developed, by means of the scatter diagram. Thereafter the\n', '314 Review\nanalytical technique by way of regression lines and the correlation\ncoefficient is described. The chapter includes several helpful worked\nexamples and computational instructions.\nThus far, both subject and treatment have, in the main, been\nfamiliar to many generations of Faculty students. It is in Chapter 5\nthat the first departure from the scope of the conventional actuarial\ntext-books appears. It is entitled " The problem of statistical\ninference " and gives first a succinct account of the nature of the\nproblem and, secondly, a brief introduction to the use of random and\nstratified sampling as an aid to making statistical inferences. It is\nreasonably successful in persuading the reader that there is more to\nstatistics than the mere summarising and presentation of data,\nand in whetting his appetite for the inevitably rather heavy meal\nwhich follows. This is none less than the theoretical bases of probability\nand tests of hypotheses which, as statisticians boldly claim,\nprovide the answers to questions of statistical inference. The two\nfollowing chapters, then, deal with probability. The first, on\n" fundamentals," has already been noticed. The second introduces\nthe random variable. One commends here the skilful and extensive\nuse made of the notion of expectation. This chapter concludes with a\nderivation of the Tchebyshev inequalities, which are applicable to\nany distribution of a random variable, subject only to very slightly\nrestrictive conditions.\nThe succeeding Chapter 8 deals with some particularly important\ndistributions. It treats of the binomial, the Poisson, and the hypergeometric\ndistributions so far as discrete variables are concerned, and\nthe normal and Pearson distributions of a continuous variable. But\nwhile it provides a breathing space from the preceding rapid development\nof generalised theory, it permits no respite mathematically.\nThe authors indeed seem almost to delight in their highly mathematical\npresentation, and only once do they relax their demands on\nthe reader, when they grant that the proof of the central limit\ntheorem is beyond the scope of their book.\nThe remaining two chapters are devoted to tests of hypotheses.\nThe first, which was discussed earlier, is concerned with the general\nproblem of tests, together with one aspect of the subject of estimation\n—viz., estimation by confidence intervals. The second describes\nsome particular tests. These include the " large sample " tests of\nwhether the mean of a normal distribution, as inferred from a sample,\nis equal to some suggested value, the procedures applicable when the\n" population" standard deviation is, respectively, known and\nunknown being distinguished. Similar tests are described of the\n', 'Review 315\ndifference between two " population " means, of a standard deviation,\nand of the difference or ratio of two standard deviations. Finally,\nthe test for a " population " proportion is set out. This chapter is,\nperhaps, the least satisfactory in the Volume, and lacks much of the\nfreshness of treatment and clarity of exposition which are its prime\ncharacteristics. In large measure, this is due to the authors\' decision\nto write the chapter on the basis of " large sample " theory. " Small\nsamples " and exact tests will presumably come in Volume II. The\nresult is, however, that the student will have quite unnecessarily\nto learn this part of the subject twice over. There is little if any\ndifficulty in presenting the small sample theory alone to the class of\nreader for whom the book is designed. That theory is of course\nequally applicable to the so-called " large" samples, and does\nindeed permit a more unified and logical exposition of the whole\nfield, wherein numerous apparently distinct tests all appear as\nparticular cases of the one general test of the Snedecor F-ratio.\nSuch a line of development was adopted by Dr. J. Wishart in his\npaper in J.S.S., vol. vi. page 172, and the interested reader may be\ninvited to study this contribution contemporaneously with Chapter\n10 of Johnson and Tetley.\nEach chapter contains a short bibliography and a collection of\nmiscellaneous examples, hints on the solution of which are given at\nthe end of the Volume. It may surprise some that as many as\n25 per cent, of these problems are of actuarial application or\ninterest, and others are of obvious general value. The whole set\nis, in the main, well selected and should offer depth of understanding\nto a student new to statistics. Some of the problems, though, wear\na rather fearsome mathematical garb, and one or two, whilst avoiding\nany suggestion of the bizarre, perhaps tend just slightly to the\nexotic. These may nevertheless be overlooked as but minor\neccentricities in a work of substantial merit.\nL. S.\n']</pre>
