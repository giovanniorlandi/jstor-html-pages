Keefe, the Commissioner\nGeneral of Immigration in his annual\nreport for the fiscal year 1909. It is\nproposed to accomplish this by codi\nfying, arranging in logical sequence\nand strengthening at their weak\npoints all existing laws on the gener\nal subject of immigration and Chi\nnese exclusion.\nSome of the principal suggestions\nare:\ns0 defining the term "alien" as to\nleave no doubt that it includes all per\nsons not citizens, extending the con\ntract labor provisions to forbid and\npenalize the inducement of immigra\ntion by false as well as genuine pro\nmises of employment, penalizing an\nattempt to import foreign laborers,\nand permitting the importation of al\nien skilled laborers if labor of like\n;ind unemployed can not be found\nhere only if the consent of the Secre\ntary of Commerce and Labor is ob\ntained in advance; increasing the fine\nagainst steamship companies for tak\n\'ng on board dangerously diseased\naliens from $100 to $200.\nMr. Keefe believes the time is ripe\nvr the adoption of even stricter mea\nsures and suggests that a proposal\nworth of careful thought is that all\nuale aliens between 16 and 50 be re\nquired to -pass physical examination\nequal to that observed for army re\nl-I"Ult8.\nTouching on the "white slave" traf\nfic the report sets out that a "spec\nial investigation conducted through\nout tne country and the general ex\nperience of the year, make it appar\nent that an enormous business is done\n:n importing and distributing foreign\nwomen for Immoral purposes, includ\ning the seduction and distribution of\nalien women and girls who enter reg-\nlarly, and also to some extent of A\nmericao women and girls. The Fed-\nral officers haive not discovered posi\ntive evidence of the existence of a\nsyndicate for those nefarious purpos\nes, but there is among those who con\nduct the business a certain esprit de\ncorps, and there ere in several cities\nclubs and headquarters where they\ncongregate."\'\nIn some cities, it is declared, the\ntraffic is connected with local politi\ncal conditions and some of the muni\nclpal authorities ane implicated or\notherwise helpless to assist in eradi\ncating the eviL The Federal Gov\nernmtnt\'s powers, it is stated, exe so\nlimited as to make it essential if any\nmarked progress is to be expected\nttiat the States and cities shall awake\nto the seriousness of the situation\nand exercise their undoubted authori\nty to put dowa the eviL\n- During the year there was a marked\nincrease In deportations as a result of\nthe campaign against the traffic. The\nprovisions on this subject In the bill\nsubmitted by Mr. Keefe to carry out\nhis recommendations are In principle\nthe same as in the bill which already\nhas passed the House except that\nthey do not go so far in the features\naffecting Interstate regulation of the\npractice.\nGratification is expressed as a re\nsult of the "experiment fa Immigra\ntion control as affecting the Japan\nese, constituted by law, proclanva-\n\'Uona and regulations following the\nin ti-Japanese agitation in California\nseveral years ago.\nThere has been a material reduc\ntion lu both, the number of Japanese\nadmitted and deported. In 190S, 9,544\nJapanese were admitted to continen\ntal United States and 8.694 to Hawaii,\nwhile for 1909 the corresponding fig\nures are 2,432, and 1,493. The number\nadmitted to the mainland and Hawaii\nwas only about 25 per cent and 17\nper cent respectively, of the numbers\nfor 1908.\nContrary to the general impression\nthe Chinese admitted to the United\nStates have Increased during the past\nfour years end Mr. Keefe is pessimis\ntic regarding the operation of the\nlaw. He concludes that the system of\nexclusion and expulsion afforded by it\nis but Illy adapted for either purpose.\nHe says:\n"Despite all that Is said and all that\nIs done, the Bureau Is always confid\nent et the close of any year that many\nChinese of the excluded classes have\nevaded the border officers, however\nvigilant they may have been, have\nsmuggled themselves or been smug\ngled ashore in seaports as sailors or\nstowaways, or have by fraud and per\njury managed to land m an apparent\nly regular wanner. There are doubt\nless now In this country at least as\n"any Chinese not entitled to residence\nr.ere as of the lawfully resident class,\nand they have entered in every way\nthat can be imagined."\nIt is urged that the exclusion laws\noe merged into the general immigra-\nion law, so that the administrative\nprocess of expulsion therein provided\nmay be used.\nThere are also a number of other\nrecommendations which the Coamiss-\noner says may be considered revolu-\n\'lonary, but are regarded as necessary\nt the law is to be effective and satis\nfactory.\nDuring 1909, 6,393 Chinese were reg-\njlarly admitted against 4,621 in\n1908, 3,255 in 1907 and 2.732 In 1906.\nThe worst feature the Commissioner\nays is that the increase Is almost\non fined to classes the members of\nwhich are or soon become laborers\nnd whose residence here violates the\nplrit of the law.\nImmigration, which during 1909, fell\n"ft froim the two previous years, the\nCommissioner say, is reasstunlng nor-\nTta.1 proportions. The months of Jan\nuary to June 1909 however showed in\ncreases over the same months of 19S\nwhich Is attributed by the Convriss-\n\'oner principally to the fact that teo!e\nnterested In steerage passenger car\nTing have traded upon and magnifle\'i\nbeyond all reasonable limits the im\nprovement in Industrial conditions to\nncourage emigration.\nAs to occupations 174,800 unskilled\naborers of tho immigrant class enter\nd and 118,933 of the emigrant class\nleparted. Of the 751,786 immigrant\nUleus who entered the United States\nluring the year 89,393 were under 14\nind 38,517 were 45 or over; of those\niver 13 years of age 191,049 could\nleither read nor write an Increase in\nhe ratio of illiteracy to 29 per cent\nas against 26 per cent in 1908. For\nvarious reasons 10.411 aliens were de\nported. Reference Is made again \'to the in\nteresting and important economic\norobleni arising from the fact that 8\nvery large proportion of Immigration\na coming from southern and eastern\nBurope, those countries furnishing 67\nper cent of the immigrants. The con\ntinuance of this preponderance is de-\nlared to be a question concerning ev\nery patriotic citizen, for it is stated\nthere cam be little hocnogenity be\ntween people of that section and the\nreal American.\nA distribution of more than 5,000\npersons was effected during the 15\nmonths ended June 1909 through the\noperations of the Division of Informa\ntion, of whom 2.565 were sent to agrl-\n\'iltnrs.1 communities. The Division is\ndirecting its efforts toward a practi\ncal solution of the problem of tre\nscarcity of farm help.\nParticular care has been taken to\n-Mrect no men to work where they\nmiarht to be used to replace labor al\nready employed. The field of activity\ncomprised 40 states and one territo\nry.\nThere were issued during the year\n37,337 certificates of naturalization,\nan excess of 11,820 over the preced\ning year. The four states hi which the\nprincipal work of naturalization was\ntransacted being New York, Pennsyl\nvania, Illinois and Massachusetts.\nQUALDTV WDMS\nYOU Will Find Quite a Difference Between Our\nNice, Juicy.

THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE.\nOne of the best articles -written on\nthe loss of confidence by the people\nIn President Taft has just appeared\nIn the Kansas City Times. It was\napparently written from a Republican\nstandpoint, and while it cannot be In\ndorsed as a whole by Democrats, yet\nIt shows in a clear and convincing\nmanner that President Taft has turn\ned his back upon the people and has\nallied himself with the Cannon and\nAldrlch reactionaries, the people who\nare playing into the hands of the\ntrusts and combinations. The article\nfollows:\nIn his Lincoln Day speech in New\nYork, last Saturday, President Taft\nadmitted a loss of popularity for his\nadministration that might cause the\nRepublican rarty to lose the next\nHouse of Representatives. He might\nhave eone further. So great haa been\nthe defection that if the presidential\nelection were to be held next Novem\nber there is probably only one Re\npublican Theodore Roosevelt who\nwould stand a chance of carrying the\ncountry against such a ticket, for ex\nample, as Gaynor and Folk.\nThis remarKaoie cnange In public\nsentiment the President devoted much\nof his speech to explaining. He at\ntributed It to the misrepresentation\nof the new Tariff Law by newspapers\ndisgruntled over not getting a larger\nreduction In the duty on paper, and to\nthe "hysteria" which he said was the\naftermath of the Roosevelt agitation\nan "hysteria," Incidentally, which\nwas responsible for his own nomina\ntion and election\nBut this explanation is Inadequate.\nSuch au alienation of supporters could\nUllery Furniture Co.\nUndertakers and Embalmers\nLadu, Assistant\nAmbulance Service.

While Roosevelt had not under\ntaken to deal with the tariff, the\ncountry knew Instinctively that he\nwas a revisionist and his proclaiming\nthe gospel of the sq-tare deal had pav\ned the way for a successful attempt\nto cut off the enormous crop of spec\nial privileges that had grown up un\nder the Dingley Law.\nWhen Mr, Taft assumed office on\na pledge of revision downward the\ncountry was ready Xo back htm to the\nlimit.

AU they ask\ned \'was a sincere and earnest effort\non the part of the President to ob\ntain an honest revision.\nIn this expectation the country was\ngrievously disappointed. While the\nbill \'was in process of framing the\n\'resident gave it no attention. A mi\nnority in the committee on ways and\nmeans desired to report a measure\nthat should be real revision. No help\nc-atue from the White House and the\neffort was defeated. The President\nconfessed to his visitors that he knew\nnothing about the tariff. He made no\neffort to learn.\nMr. Taft had teen nominated and\nelected as a representative of the pro\ngressive Roosevelt wing of the Re\npublican p3rty. Once In office he no\nlonger consulted with his real friends.\nAppnrently he felt the need of con\nciliating his opponents, and on the\ntariff he took counsel only with repre-\n,IS\nsentatives of the Stand-patters with\nCannon, Payne and Aldrlch. These\nmen were wholly out of touch with\nthe people and their views dominated\n\' the President\'s. They saw to It that\nthere was no intervention from the\nWhite House until It was too late to\naccomplish anything worth while.\nTwo things the country had expect\ned from the extra session.

Suppose Your House Should Burn Tonight.\nARE YOU INSURED?\nCOMMERCIAL\nTHE BEST WORK AT\nREMEMBER The Record Office is\nNow Located at 118 East 4th Street. . Just\nSouth of the Goiirt House\nlooked for a revision cn a scientific\nbasis In accordance \'with the plat\nform pledge In which -the old system\nof trades and pull should be aban\ndoned. It had looked for real revision\ndownward; for revision that would\naffect the price of living.\nIn spite of the President\'s asser\ntions, the nation knows that it lost\non both counts. And it was shocked\nthat no word of protest came from\nMr. Taft while the contest was in\nLprogress. There was the same frank\nly admitted system of bargains, the\nsame recognition of political pull,\nthe same cynical disregard of party\npledges that had existed under the\nold regime and that had been made\nodious by the new belief in the square\ndeal. Two of the Republican leaders\nin the Senate brazenly denied that\nthere had been any promise of revis\nion downward, and the White House\nwas silent. The country which had ex\npected a rigorous rebuke to be admin\nistered by the President saw these\ntwo senators continue to be called in\nto consultation In the executive offic\nes while the progressives, who were\nworking to keep the pledge, not only\nreceived no help, but were Ignored In\nthe White House conferences.\nWhen tne Tariff Bill was signed the\nnation knew that of the group that\nsurrounded the President not a single\nnan had favored his nomination. All\nuad been his enemies; all had oppos\ned tariff revision.\nAfter the session was ended the\ngeneral dissatisfaction increased. The\ntariff was defended and the progress\nives were attacked In the President\'s\nWinona speech. Meanwhile the field\nagent of the land office, who had been\nactive in trying to protect the people\'s\ncoal lands, was dismissed from the\nservice. Then came the Ballinger in\nvestigation and the dismissal of the\nnan above all others to whom the\nnation owes a debt of gratitude in a\nwakening it to the necesssity of con\nnerving the national resources.\nSo today there can be little en thus\nlam over the President\'s declarations\nfor progressive measures In dealing\ntth trusts and railroads. The declar\nitlons sound well, but so did the\nspeeches for revision downward in\n\'he campaign. The record does not In\npire confidence that he will have the\nforce and sagacity to hve his way a\'\nratnst such experienced and aggres\nslve reactionaries as Cannon and Aid\nich.\nIn all this transformation of public\nsentiment there has been very little\nbitterness. Instead there has been\ngeneral sorrow over the loss of confi\nrtence in a President of charming per\nsonality and right intentions, who\nnartly from temperament, partly from\nlack of sagacity, partly from demcien\ny In aggressive, militant earnestness.\nhas alienated the people who believed\nthev had founa in him the man to car\ny on the work begun by Roosevelt\nHere has been outlined the exist\nIng situation and the events that have\nled to it. No one can know what the\nfuture has in store, or whether the\nlost confidence may be regained. But\nthe Republican party for the present\nIs called on to face this undoubted\n\'act:\nIf the presidential election were to\nbe held this year Mr. Taft could not\ncarry a state west of the Allegheny\nmountains.\nAnd over this fact no men grieve\nnore sincerely than those who built\nheir hopes on him, and helped cause\nhis nomination.\nCARING FOR CHILDEN.\nThere can be no greater work than\nthat of caring for homeless children\nor for those whose homes are such as\nto be as bad as no homes at all. For\nthe past several years this work has\nleen taken up in New Mexico by Dr,\nOharles E. Lukens, and It has been\nwell and ably handled by him and his\nassistants. Much good has been ac\nlonipllshed, and the field of endeavor\ns being gradually extended as the\nPRINTING\nREASONABLE PRICES\n!\ni 1\n. p\n-sources of the society of which Dr.\ni-Aikens is the head permits.\nYet despite these self-evident facts\nopposition has developed. The cause\nof it seems to he founded on personal\ndislike, to a certain extent, and to the\nfact that certain parties have not been\npermitted to control the operations of\nthe society. And back of this there\nmay he found religious prejudices. .\nConsiderable of this opposition has\nomenated from Carlsbad. Misstate\nment a have been repeatedly publish\ned, followed up by personal abuse and\nslander of the worst type.\nThe case of "Little Minnie," who is\nbeing restored to a life of usefulness\nthrough the work of the Children\'s\nHome Society, was seized upon aa\npresenting an opportunity for this sort\nf dirty work, and statements abso\nlutely uncalled for and false In every\nparticular were spread broadcast ov\nr the territory.\nYet the work of caring for these\nchildren continues to go forward, "Lit\ntle Minnie" will be restored sound in\nbody and mind to her mother, and no\nopportunity to care for children who\nneed care will be avoided.\nAs In instance of the feeling In re\ngard to the work of the society, we\npublish elsewhere a communication\nirocn certain well-known citizens of\nCarlsbad, who resent the falsehoods\nand slanders enienating from their\nsection of the territory.\nIn Roswell where Dr. Lukens is so\nwell known and where he has so many\noorsonal friends It is hardly necessa\nry to comment on the work he Is do\ning, but it may not be amiss to give\np iblicity to the feelings expressed In\nthe lower valley.\nNotice of Pending Suit.\nA.

M, Feb. 14, 1910.\nTo the People of New Mexico:\nWe, the undersigned citizens of\nCarlsbad, Eddy County, New Mexico,\nhaving been conversant with the ex\ncellent work done by Dr. C. E. Luk\nens, through the organization known\nas the Children\'s Home Society of\nNew Mexico, and It having come to\nour attention that certain criticisms\nhad been made of him. and of his work\nin relation to a case popularly known\nas the case of "Little Minnie," In\nwhich Dr. Lukens was charged with\ncruelty in caring for the child, we\nlhave voluntarily made certain invest!-\ngations in regard to such rumors anJ\nhave fully satisfied ourselves that said\nrumors were not only unfounded In\nfact but were untrue and a great in\njustice to the Association of which\nDr. Lukens has the management and\nalso a great injustice to the many\ngenerous and philanthropic people\nwho have contributed to the support\nof the society. Certain statements\nhave appeared in the public press to\nthe effect that the people of Eddy\ncounty are incensed over the action\nof Dr. Lukens In connection with this\ncase and we wish to distinctly say\nthat the good people of this portion\nof Eddy County fully appreciate the\ngood work done and emphatically ap\nprove the course pursued by Dr. Lu\nkens In this particular case. We have\nIjiterviewed the witnesses who were\npresent on the train at the time of the\nalleged unkind treatment of the child\nand find that they deny not only hwv\ning made the statements attributed to\nthem, but say emphatically that the\ntreatment accorded the child was\nnone other than what any parent\nmight exercise in the care and man\nagement of a child under like circum\nstances.\nWe have known Dr. Lukens person\nally for many years. His high char\nacter and good reputation ace too well\nknown In the Pecos Valley to require\nour endorsement. We are in hearty\nsympathy with the good work he had\ndone In Eddy County for the relief of\ndestitute children and for placing ma\nny of them in desirable homes. We\nheartily commend him and his good\nwork to the people of New Mexico,\namd we earnestly hope that the unkind\ncriticisms which have been made will\nenlist the active co-operation of peo\nple disposed to aid unfortunate child\nren and we assure him and the Child\nren\'s Home Soeiety of our active co\noperation and assistance.\nA.
