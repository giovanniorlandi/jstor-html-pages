        <pre>['Dietary lipids: less fat or best fat?\nObesity is now recognized as a chronic\ndisease that affects the risk of many\nother diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular\ndisease, cancer, etc. notably via\ninflammation.\nThis overload of body fat is often\nconsidered as the result of excess in fat\nintake, as if the consumptionof excess fat\ndirectly generated the development of\nfat mass. The result of this shortcut is\nsummed up in a tendency to recommend\nthe ‘‘less fat’’ diet, but forget that\nthe diet is a complex assembly of foods\nthat are vectors of many nutrients\nincluding lipids.\nHowever, overweight and obesity affects\nnearly half of the French population\n(ObEpi, 2012) with nearly a third of\nthe population overweight (BMI between\n25.0 and 29.9) and 15% of obese\npeople. In addition, the waist size,\nrecognized as an indicator of abdominal\nfatmass,hasonaveragea steady increase\nsince 1997 (the beginning of the investigation\nObEpi), with a gain of 3.8 cm on\naverage for men and 6.8 cm in women.\nIn 2012, a third of men and 40% of\nwomen have a waist size greater than\n102 and 88 cm respectively, these\nthresholds being considered as ‘‘at risk’’.\nThe latest OECD data show the same\ntype of development around the world,\nwith 35% of obese people in the United\nStates in 2010 and projections for 2020\nAbstract: Obesity and overweight occurrence is growing around the word. This is often\nconsidered as a consequence of high fat diets, and some recommendations encourage\n‘‘light’’ diets, including low fat intake. However, most trials with low fat intake do not\ndemonstrate any benefit and could be worse than low carbohydrate diets. The key role of\ninsulin could explain that eating fat do not make body fat. On the other hand, several\nunbalanced fatty acid intake are reported, i.e. saturated/mononunsaturated fatty acids\nand w6/w3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, fat intake could be improved in this\nrespect. Moreover, the molecular and supramolecular structures of fat in food are new\nchallenges to address in order to ameliorate the recommendations for healthy diets.\nKey words: lipids, nutrition, obesity, insulin\nJean-Michel CHARDIGNY\nClermont Universit\x01e,\nUniversit\x01e d’Auvergne,\nUnit\x01e de Nutrition Humaine,\nBP 10448,\nF-63000 Clermont-Ferrand,\nFrance;\nINRA,\nUMR 1019,\nCentre de Recherche de Theix,\nF-63122 Saint Genes Champanelle,\nFrance\n<jean-michel.chardigny@clermont.\ninra.fr>\nTo cite this article: Chardigny JM.

In 1998, Willett\nsummarized in a paper entitled ‘‘Is\ndietary fat a major determinant of\nbody fat?’’ that ‘‘Diets high in fat do\nnot appear to be the primary cause of\nthe high prevalence of excess body\nfat in our society, and reductions in fat\nwill not be a solution’’. This was based\non evidence from the discrepancy\nbetween the tendency to decrease\nfat intake between the 70’ and the\n90’ and the increase in overweight\npopulation in the US (figure 2).\nHalton et al. (2006) also reported\nthe lack of increase in coronary heart\ndiseases when changing the fat intake\nfrom 26.9 to 39.8 En%. The\nWomen’s Health Initiative Randomized\nControlled Dietary Modifications\nTrial also showed that the reduction\nof dietary fat (from 37.8 to 28.8 En\n%) did not result in any reduction of\ncardiovascular or stroke risk in postmenopausal\nwomen (Howard et al.,\n2006). Such results have also been\nconfirmed in intervention trials. As an\nexample, Ebbeling et al. (2007)\nreported in that a low carbohydrate\ndiet was more beneficial considering\nHDL and TG plasma concentrations\n(figure 3).\nIn this context, insulin is probably one of\nthe key players in the complex metabolic\nregulation. Insulin is known to\nfacilitate the de novo synthesis of fatty\nacids from excess circulating glucose\nand to inhibit the free fatty acid release\nfrom adipose tissue. Thus, insulin which\nplasma concentration is increased after\ncarbohydrate intake but also in insulin\nresistance situations, could considered\nas one of the major player to facilitate\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nP\ner\nce\nn\nta\ng\ne \n(%\n)\nDietary fat (as percentage of energy)\nPercent of population overweight\n1971-1974 1976-1980 1988-1991\nFigure 2.

It is well\nknown that excess of saturates intake is\nrelated to an increase in cardiovascular\nrisk, but all the saturated fatty acids\ncannot be considered as a single bulk.\nAs stated by Mensink et al. (2003)\nmeta-analysis, the different saturated\nfatty acids do not similarly impact\nthe plasma cholesterol biomarkers\n(figure 5). It has also been documented\nthat short chain fatty acids have a\ndifferent metabolic impact than C12C18\nSFAs.\nThe second major unbalance in dietary\nfatty acids is the excess in omega\n6 intake compared to omega-3. This\nunbalanced has progressed from the\nmiddle of the past century and has been\nclearly demonstrated by Ailhaud et al.\nby analyzing the fatty acid profile of\nhuman milk (figure 6). As the benefit of\nomega 3 fatty acids in primary prevention\nof disease is continuously under\ndebate (including alpha-linoleic acid\nvs EPA and DHA), this unbalance is\nmore clearly documented. However,\nthis questions the bioavailability and\nsustainability particularly for long chain\nn-3 fatty acids, but new sourcing like\nalgal production and/or valorisation of\nfishing by-products could be considered\nfor the future.\nMoreover, dietary fatty acids are not\npresent as free fatty acids in the diet. As\nthey are mainly present as triacylglycerols,\nphospholipids are present indifferent\nfood items and phospholipids could be a\nspecific carrier to address long chain fatty\nacids. As an example, Bunea et al. (2004)\nreported in that 3 g/d of krill oil or 3 g/d\nof fish oil did not alter plasma lipids to\nthe same extent. Krill oil (phospholipids)\nwas more beneficial on plasma\nlipids, suggesting specific metabolic\ntrends of PL-esterified fatty acids. This\ncould also be considered for other\nPL-rich food items as egg yolk.\nAnother issue to be considered is the\nsupramolecular structure of food items.\nThanks to the LISTRAL network, this\nissue has recently be reviewed (RaynalLjutovac\net al., 2011). Unfortunately,\nconsolidated data in this respect are still\nlacking and would be helpful for further\nrecommendations which would be\nmore food-based than isolated nutrients-based.\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n-0.02\n-0.04\n∗ ∗\n∗\n∗\n∗\n∗\n∗\n∆T\no\nta\nl \n: \nH\nD\nL \nch\no\nle\nst\ner\no\nl\n∆L\nD\nL \nch\no\nle\nst\ner\no\nl \n(m\nm\no\nl/\nL)\n∆\nLD\nL ch\no\nlestero\nl (m\nm\no\nl/L)\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n-0.02\n-0.04\nLauric acid\nPalmitic acid\nMyristic acid\nStearic acid\nFigure 5.
