And the word for, the extra spurt came from the head, quarters of the Alaska engineering, commission at Anchorage, presum, ably, for all things relative to the Sew, ard division originate from the An, chorage office., As a consequence of the forthcom, ing inspection, every man from the, Talkeetna division, every available, man from the Anchorage division, is, now out on the Seward division north, of Mile 47, according to unofficial ad, vices. The large number of men, rushed suddenly to the new front line, of defense comprise T. & T. men,, bridge builders, snowshed men, track- <, layers, tie layers, pick and shovel men,, etc. The sidings north of Mile 47 look, as if a circus train had been switched, north. There are the bunk cars, mess *, cars and the best of the rolling stock, from the Anchorage division. Hun- 1, dreds of men are working, not only ^, on the day shift, but the orders are to ■, work two shifts, night and day., After five years’ waiting the rush, orders finally were issued and now, everything is feverish, because the, members of the house coming North, probably are going to make a real in, spection and not a “whitewashing” in, spection., But what are the powers that be, going to say when the question is, asked, “Why the sudden excitement, and great rush? Who delayed the, game? For what purpose was con, struction work held up? Why was, the appropriation for the Seward di, vision always cut, when the Seward, division is the outlet of the great and, grand and gigantic enterprise of gov, ernment ownership?”, The average person would rather, be down on Fox island than in the, shoes of the Anchorage authorities,, because there are going to be some, questions asked that are going to be, hard to give a reasonable answer to, But hundreds of extra men are,, lowever, rushing work on the Seward, livision for a purpose, and that pur, pose is clear—to do something so that, ;he house members may be able to, •ide from Seward to Anchorage after, ive years of construction work on a, •abroad which was at one time a rail, •oad and traffic was in operation., Special dinner served froqj 11:30, j’clock every day at the Cit^ Bakery., It’s the flavor and the grain which, nake the bread at the City Bakery, amous., Shoe repairing.

Steve Oros., 3hone 130. 29-6t, Subscribe for the Daily Times., Reports received from the Koyukuk, indicate that the old-timers of the Arc, tic camp are not very much excited, over c^e “strikes” which were report, ed earlier in the year to have been, a r de in that district, and no one has, left the Koyukuk towns or old-time, creeks to ascertain whether or not the, stories are true., Conditions at Betties are about as, they usually are during the summer, months, with probably a few more peo-1, pie in town than usual, because of the i, arrival of the first boat of the season, with fresh supplies. It was too early, in the season, when the Reliance vis, ited the Koyukuk, to form an estimate, of the summer’s output, but the opin, ion prevailed that the district would, produce about as much this year as, last., One of the stories of the Koyukuk, discovery received at Fairbanks was, to the effect that good pay had been, found on the Betties river, with indi, cations that the paystreak was at least, twelve miles in length. A quantity of, gold dust, reported to have been, taken from the Betties ground by the, discoverer, was on display at Tanana, early in the summer., The appearance of the ledge on the, divide between Moose and Friday, creeks, in the Kantishna district,, which is being opened up by the Ait, ken party, is improving with depth,, according to J. A. Haney, who arrived, in Fairbanks with a number of sam, ples for assay recently., The shaft had reached a depth of, thirty-five feet when Haney left camp,, and the work is now proceeding as, rapidly as two shifts of miners of, three men each can rush it. More, than that number of men, Mr. Haney, said, can not be used with economy, at this time. The shaft is a small, one, merely to determine the values, and extent of the ledge, and will be, abandoned when the real develop, mnt work starts. Should the results, of the present work prove satisfac, tory, the ledge will be tapped with a, tunnel at a much lower level., The work of moving supplies to the, camp from the river landing at Roose, velt is proceeding steadily with two, pack horses, and if it should be de, cided to work on a larger scale dur, ing the winter, a considerable quantity, of supplies will be landed at Rooseyelt, before the close of navigation., Recent reports from Rampart go to, show that the camp is still taking out, money. On the upper end of Little, Manook creek, the oldest producer of, the camp, considerable winter work, was done on the ground owned by, John W. Duncan. The same ground, is now being worked by an open cut,, and from the size of the cut, this, ground should have a good clean-up, this summer., The lower end of the same creek is, also worked by the same method, and, will probably produce some this sum, mer., There are two hydraulic plants in, operation on Hunter creek. The up, per end of the creek is owned and, worked by Charles Swanson. A small, clean-up was made early this summer,, which amounted to about six thousand, dollars, or about two dollars to the, foot. It is expected that this ground, will clean up about twenty thousand, dollars before the freexe-up., The lower end of this creek is, owned and worked by A. Ott, who is, also well satisfied with his work so, far this season., Little Manook, Jr., and Slate creeks, are also being worked, but not to any, great extent, owing to the few people, located there., M.

Last year the high price of, rice led to serious riots throughout, the empire., The Japan Temperance Society has, presented a memorial to the govern, ment urging the prohibition of the, making of rice. The organization, points out that about 15,000,000 bush, els of rice are consumed yearly in its, manufacture. With the population of, Japan increasing at the rate of 600,, 000 yearly, and the national rice crop, falling on account of the decrease of, rice lands through civic and industrial, expansion, the organization asserts, that the enormous quantity of rice, used in distilling sake might be turned, to a better use in distributing it as, food for the people. j, Emperor Yoshihito is said to be, deeply concerned over the living con, ditions among his people.

The, judge is absent, undergoing treatment, for illness. His absence, from the, time of his departure until his re, turn, will probably extend to half a, year. We all, of course, deeply sym, pathize with the district judge because, of his illness. We all hope for his, speedy recovery. But the business of, the court, which is so highly impor, tant, should not be hindered or de, layed on account of the illness of the, district judge. Provision should be, made for the appointment of a tempo, rary judge, to serve during the ab, sence from the district, from any, cause whatsoever, of the regular ju, dicial officer. This would prevent any, delay in the adjudication of important, cases. There are half a dozen impor, tant cases in this community that, should be tried immediately, but in, the circumstances their trial is unnec, essarily deferred because of the en, forced absence of a court of compe, tent jurisdiction. It is a situation that, should be corrected, and one that, might easily be remedied by the ap, pointment of a temporary judge. We, make this statement solely in the in, terests of good government. We have, the utmost confidence in and respect, for our district judge, and have no, wish to see him replaced because of, his illness. This should not be neces, sary, if our suggestion were adopted., Nothing should be allowed to interfere, with the operations of the district, court.—Anchorage Times., TO OUR NAPOLEON, Now we understand why Victory, medals are to be struck off. A spe, cial dispatch to the New York Sun, contains this gripping information;, “Washington, June 26.—Newton D., Baker, secretary of war, will decorate, himself with a Victory medal as soon, as these war emblems are ready to, be issued. Announcement that Mr., Baker will receive the second medal, to be issued was made by the war, department today. President Wilson, Mill receive the first.”, As there is no one who can properly, perform the act of decorating the sec, retary of war except himself he will, do the honors. Of course the Presi, dent might officiate, introducing the, ceremony he learned in France. He, would pin the medal on the heaving, chest of the modest, blushing secre, tary and then kiss him on both, cheeks a la Francaise. We think, that, all circumstances considered, the, secretary should not only be decorat, do but kissed., That was a fine thought of the sec, retary’s to put the President first and, himself second among the heroes of, the great war. All of us remember, the intrepid actions of the secretary, when he was in France; how he, crawled from communicating trench, to support trench and from support, trench to the front line trench and, gazed through a periscope at the fero, cious enemy. Not so many remember, that historic scene when the president, of France hooked a military medal, a, croix de guerre and the medal of Le, gion of Honor on the secretary’s left, hand breast pocket and said;, “It was you who won the war; you, who sent us over so many American, seventy-fives and such a swarm of air, planes; you who made so many mag, nificent threats that the enemy wilted,, turned pale and ran for the Rhine.”, Could anything be more appropri, ate by way of official recognition than, the Victory medal for the little sec, retary. If we may not ascribe the, victor to him, to whom may we as, cribe it. Surely no one would be so, unfeeling as to say that anyone did, his bit more gloriously than our Na, poleonic secretary. Was he not the, man behind the man behind the gun—, and then some? And when duty, called, did he not sail across the sea,, land amid the swamps of Brest, rush, madly to the front when the armies, had begun to waver before the as, saults of the Hun, take one peek at, the foe and then turn right around, again and come home? Did he or did, he not?, Oh, Victory, instead of allowing, Newton to pin a medal on himself,, thou shouldst come down from thy ex, alted place, take the little secretary, by the hand and place him beside thee, on the very armchair of thy throne., For is not Newton but another name, for Victory? it or is it not?, VOICE OF THE ALASKA PRESS, An effort is to be made by the Ne, nana Commercial Club to induce the, postoffice department to route Interior, Alaska mail during the coming winter, by way of the new Broad Pass trail,, which is now approaching the Interior, rapidly from the end of steel in the, Anchorage division of the government, railroad.—Nenana News., Possibly the visit of Colonel D. C., Jackling to this section will have, some relative change in the steamer, service of the Admiral line.

They are, or should be vitally concerned with, civic, economic and other social inter, ests.”, Rights of workingmen to share in, the control of industries are set forth, in this statement at length. “We, have come upon times when people, are not submissive to injustice or to, unnecessary privation and suffering,”, declares the church commission., “They are deeply and justly in ear, nest. If those who are the actual, industrial, political and social leaders, of the nation will not act upon the, principle that the greatest shall be the, servant of all, then the people them, ■ selves, with indignation and bitter, ness, are sure to take their destiny, and that of the world into their own, I hands., “Class-consciousness and the use of, violence are not confined to the revo, lutionary groups. The possession of, wealth and education tend to the for, mation of classes, and industrial own, ership and management to a class, conscious ruling group. We observe, the dangerous tendency of many state, and municipal officials to deny fail, hearings to radical offenders and to, use unnecessary and provocative bru, tality during strikes., “Legislatures, judges and officials, should act firmly but justly, without j, bluster and without unnecessary vio, lence. Workingmen believe that they, do not get an equal chance before the, law, and it is highly important that j, whatever real basis there is for this, conviction should be removed., “A deep cause of unrest in industry, is the denial to labor of a share in, industrial management. Laborers, must be recognized as being entitled, to as much consideration as employ, ers, and their rights must be equally, safeguarded. This may be accom, plished by assuring the workers\' as, rapidly as it can be done with due, consideration to conditions a fail, share in control; by opportunity for, - ownership with corresponding repre, sentation; or by a combination of own, ership and control in co-operative pro, duction., “The living wage should be made, the first charge upon industry before, dividends are considered. The resist, ance of labor to general wage reduc, tions, even when accompanied by re, duced hours of work, should receive, moral support from the community,, except where the demand is clearly, unreasonable. Wage levels must be, high enough to maintain a standard of, living worthy of responsible, free citi, ■ zenship in a democracy., “Actual wages, that is, wages reck, oned in power to purchase commodi, ties, have been decreasing for several, years in spite of wage increases. There, is urgent need of provision by indus, try under the guidance of the govern, ment for some regular method of ad, justment of wages and salaries to the, purchasing power of money. High, wages are desirable as a general prin, ciple.”, Employers who justify low wages, or wage reductions should open their, books and submit their figures to pub, lic scrutiny, adds the commission., To provide employment, the com, mission advocates that a nation-wide, employment service be maintained,, and suggests adoption of a policy of, public works and land settlement, a, guarded extension of opportunities for, social insurance to cover unemploy, ment due to industrial conditions or, ill health, and the rehabilitation of in, dustrial cripples under the direction, of the state and at the expense of in, dustry. A general policy of vocational, training is approved., Concerning the payment of the war, debt, it is pointed out that “powerful, influences are organized to shift the, burdens of this debt on the public,, while the public itself is unorganized, and practically unable to protect, itself.”, A revolt, the commission says, al, " ready has taken place against the pol, " icy of levying direct taxes upon minor, PITIFUL STATE, OF RESIDENTS, OF MACEDONIA, KAVADAR, Macedonia, June 10, (Correspondence of Associated Press), —Without food, without medical at, tention with hardly any growing, crops promising relief when the har, vest comes 15,000 refuges of this dis, trict ho,ve returned and are desper, ately clinging to the litte mountain, farms which are their patrimony. Ra, ther than abandon them they will die, in the ruins and caves which today, only half shield them from the ele, ments., To this field the Balkan Commis, sion of the Red Cross has sent Cap, tain R M Blakely, USA medical, corps, of New Orleans, La, with five, nurses and several car loads of sup, plies. Villages within a radius of 50, kilometers are now being served by, the “Amerikanska.” Medicines are, given at the dispensary which never, charge a dinard for its service or for, flcur, clothing and other supplies for, tl:e canteen. What that means to a, people who have come back from ex, ile after three years of deprivation, of the necessities of life, to find, their homes in ruins can best be ap, preciated here on the spot., The station here at Kavadar is but, ore of hundreds of similar stations, in Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, Ru, mania Herzegovina and Greece which, the Balkan Commission of the Am, erican Red Cross has established., The town hall is used for an in, firmary, and an empty house for a, food and clothing warehouse and an, old mill has been made into a bakery., The dispensary is crowded from, morning to night. Some days 250, patients are treated. The maimed, and stricken come from a radius of, 30 miles. One patient was brought, in on an ox cart from an unbroken, journey of four days. Tuberculosis, i:i every form, onaemia and other ills, that follow in the wake of under, feeding and poor housing have af, fected a third of the population., luxuries of the people. Aesolute use,, it adds, should be of the graduated, income and inheritance taxes, as “a, just method for placing the heavier, burdens upon those most able to bear, them.”, The church asserts that it stands, for a living wage for industrial women, and equal pay for equal work. It urges, persons having free capital to invest, it irt homes for workers. It points to, the need of community centers to re, place the saloon, and declares that, churches should be open seven days, in the week., SMOKERS!, Do you know the Horseshoe, Billiard Hall carries one of the, most complete stocks of Tobacco, and Cigars handled by any store, in Alaska?, We have special facilities for, storing tobacco to preserve its, strength and insure it reaching, you in perfect condition.

Coffey gave the, hungry members of the Anchorage ad, visory board to crack at the special, meeting last night held in the town, site office. The mayor-editor received, his information first hand from Mr., Gerig, engineer in charge, who in turn, was advised to this effect by William, C. Edes of Washington, who in this, case acts as the actual chief advisor, as well as railroad commissioner., Following this bomb, that shattered, hopes of additional sidewalks, street, improvements, water main extensions, and other minor improvements at this, time, Chairman F. M. Boyle stated that, the meeting was open for remarks,, complimentary and otherwise, to the, advisory citizens who form the board., Like the call to meals, the opportu, nity was seized upon by several mem, bers who realize their duty to their, constituents, and strange to say, the, tiuestion of dogs, their uses, abuses, and pedigree, was thoroughly dis, cussed, to the end that the overworked, mayor was appointed to can the dogs., A graduating scale of tax will be, imposed on all dogs, and rules and, regulations passed fully covering the, ever-present dog nuisance that is be, coming a menace to life and property., Many and various complaints wrere re, ceived by the board from law-abiding, citizens and taxpayers, setting forth, the depredations committed and pray, ing for immediate relief. The ques, tion of livestock being allowed to, roam over the town lawns and private, gardens received due consideration,, and this nuisance will be abated, through proper and drastic channels., During the course of the lengthy, meeting the fact wras prominently, brought out that the territorial legis, lature passed a lawr at the last ses, sion providing for a board of seven, trustees and a mayor for all unincor, porated towns. The act gives the, trustees ^power to pass laws, levy, taxes, fix penalties and other powers, applicable to all well-regulated and, well-conducted towns such as Anchor, age. ^, Several of the members were in, favor of taking advantage of the law, and disbanding forthwith. But after, due consideration and deliberation it, was decided to continue to advise un, til the expiration of their term, which, will be in about sixty days. At that, time, in accordance with the law, an, election will be called to elect seven, trustees and mayor, who will guide, the destiny of Anchorage until the, government sees fit to relinquish its, right or until the voice of the people, demands a change., With the understanding that the, chairman could call a special meeting, at his pleasure, or would do so upon, request, Advisors Bennet, Lynch,, Cribb and McCain voted in the af, firmative to adjourn. It was not neces, sary for Chairman Boyle to vote, and, Mayor Coffey, who is in the same em, barrassing position as Alaska’s dele, gate in congress, had no votee.

The child, has attracted the attention of Europe, since he was four years old, but it, was only recently that his American, birth was revealed by his parents, who are Italian., The father told the Associated Press, correspondent that Willy carried an, American passport, but that his name, thereon was William Ferrero, a name, he had chosen for him while he had, worked in Maine when the child was, born., The father said that at the age of, two the lad was brought to Italy,, whither his parents were returning to, take up their residence in their old, home in Turin. When Willy was four, he began his musical career, leading, an orchestra in the Folies Bergere, in, Paris. A year later he appeared in, the Costanza theater, Rome, where, for the first time he led an orchestra, of 100 pieces. The program was com, posed of Wagnerian, Beethoven and, other heavy selections., The child took his orchestra before, Emperor Nicholas in 1913, and con, ducted two concerts for the monarch., In the same year his orchestra was, filling an engagement in London, and, he was commanded to appear before, Queen Alexandra of England at Marl, borough house. He appeared before, Pope Benedict XV in 1916., In April, 1915, just before Italy’s, declaration of war, Willy was present, ed with the gold medal by the Italian, minister of education, after he had, made a successful appearance in the, Augusteum, where he had conducted, an orchestra and chorus aggregating, 500 participants., All the players in the orchestra are, men of long musical experience., IMPORTATION OF PLANTS, BARRED ON ACCOUNT, OF MENACE OF INSECTS, BRUSSELS, June 12 (by mail).—, The City of Ghent, which is noted for, its magnificent botanical garden, is, greatly concerned over the ruling of, the American Department of Agricul, ture, prohibiting the importation of, live plants owing to danger of insect, infection. It is stated that this will, mean a yearly loss of business am, ounting to two million dollars., As no shipments have been made to, America for the last three years it, is felt that Americans have no proof, as to the existence of insect menace,, and the authorities have requested, through the Consular channels that, an American expert be sent to Ghent, to test the soil and plants, in the, hope that the prohibition will be, withdrawn., We always have a supply of, pasteurized sweet milk and cream on, hand.

This 2, is the assurance brought back from ;, Mount Katmai by the expedition of 2, ©, the Beaux-Art Features Co. of Los •, Angeles, whose producing company 2, has been in the valley making proto- 2, play scenes for use in forthcoming •, screen features. 2, •, When the Katmai volcano erupted •, in 1912 and covered thousands of 2, square miles with ash and pumice, 2, killing all the vegetation and game, •, and wiping out more than one set- 2, tlement, it was regarded as a great •, calamity. But the eruption uncov- 2, ered a strange formation which is •, declared to be one of the wonders of •, the world, exceeding in beauty the 2, Yellowstone and other great national 2, parks; and already there is a move- j, ment on foot to develop tourist traffic 2, to this extraordinary freak of na- •, ture., Besides the scenic possibilities, 2, which will shortly be shown on the ®, screen in Beaux-Art pictures, the 2, ©, valley is said to possess vast depos- •, its of practically pure sulphur, arse- 2, nic and other chemical elements. •, Black sand was found in profusion in 2, the beds of the streams, a fact de- •, a, serving the attention of prospectors. 2, The atmosphere resulting from the •, unique association of steam, hot mud «, and the eternal snows w\'hich ring •, the vallev, is remarkably bracing, t, C, Sufferers from rhuematism, dyspepsia 2, and other ailments, it is declared, g, will be benefited if not entirely cured •, by a short stay in the valley. 1 2, “The finest pot of beans imagina- ;, ble,” said Miss Dixie Dawson, the 2, company’s leading lady, “is what any j, amateur cook can cook in the Valley l, of Smokes. You just cover your pork 2, and beans in snow water, rie the «, lid on the pot and let it into one of 2, the steam holes.

There is no wood in the val- J, ley, so you can’t fry or broil, but we \\, found out how to bake the most de, licious bread. We had to carry in our j ’, tent poles from a point seven miles, iway, where the last of the dead cot, onwoods, blasted by the volcano,, were not entirely buried by the pu, nice.”, The “smokes,” literaly thousands of, them, are clouds of jets of steam tin, ier various pressures, emitted from, holes and huge caverns in the solid, ified volcanic clay. The entire valley, which is shaped something like a clo, ser leaf, seems to be gradually solid, ifying. According to the Indian, ?uide who found the trail for the mo, tion picture party, many miles of the, hot mud, now safe to cross, were in, semi-liquid condition a year ago when, he was there., In one of the three arms of the, valley is a “live” glacier of consider, able size, at the foot of which is a, beautiful cobalt-blue lake of hot wat, er. In another arm is situated the, Falling Mountain, down whose face i, inclined at an angle of about 50 de, grees to the horizontal, roll contin-1, ually huge boulders, broken off from, the snow-caped peaks by variations, of temperature., These and other unique points of, interest are capable of being reached, by automobile from an advantageous, site for a hotel on the high ground, where the camp of the picture expe, dition was pitched. Indeed, the en, tire thirty-two miles of the valley, it, is said, can be made into a boulevard, for motor cars at moderate expense., While the thirt^rfive mile trail, over which the party “mushed” is, very difficult, lying through long, grass and burnt alders, over ranges, of pumice stone and up the beds of, painted streams, investigation shows, that an easier way into the valley is, possible by aut6mobie road of not, more than eighteen miles., From samples of the many thous, ands of feet of film exposed in the, cameras of the Beaux-Art photograph, ers, it is evident that the surpassing, beauty and strangeness of the valley, will appeal to hundreds of tourists,, who will no longer be satisfied merely, to make the round trip along the, ccast, but will demand transportation, and accommodations which will ena, ble them to see “the show place of, Alaska.”, Electricity for service, that’s why, ye sell electric waffle Irons, toasters,, grills, toast-stoves, immersion heaters,, jurling irons, cozy-glow heaters,, md everything.
