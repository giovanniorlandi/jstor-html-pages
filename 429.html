        <pre>['THE EUEEKA SENTINEL.\nESTABLISHED 1870 EUREKA. NEVADA. DECEMBER 25, 11(09 PUBLISHED SATURDAYS\n^^estern Beef Finds Good Market\nWestern Beef is coming into its own. Not over a decade ago\nEastern buyers purchased range bred steers only when they were\nunable to fill their feed pens from other sources, and usually\noffered a much lower price for this class of stock than they wore\nwilling to pay for that secured from other places.\nExperience has taught these buyers, however, that Western\nrange bred steers are usually in the very best of health. They\nhave a splendid frame upon which to build, are well muscled and\nb»ned, and being accustomed to the rigors of the Western climate,\ncontinue to put on flesh in the Eastern feed pens when cattle from\nother sections, being fed under identical conditions, are losing flesh\non account of the inclem»“* weather conditions. This Western\niteeronly demands the* h0 be gi»en plenty of good fresh water and\nsufficient feed so the* he may neve* be hungry, and he will always\ngive a good -^count of himself and retu.n many dollars in profits\n/yder when he is aold few the block in tho Spring.\nTheta steers shed early under favorable conditions, and when\nthey have reached the stockyards they show an exterior finish that\nother cattle, lacking the same health and ruggedness, fail to show.\nThis makes the Western steers ready sellers ou the market, and\nafter they have been butchered the percentage of the weight of the\ndressed carcass over that of other steers under the same conditions\nis so perceptible as to immediately attract the attention of those\nkeen, far sighted men who handle the yard end of the business.\nThe settlement of the West is rapidly reducing the amount of\navailable range and is forcing the cattle to go higher and higher\ninto the hills in soarch of forage. This is greatly increasing the\nimportance of freely utilizing the ranges within the National For.\nests, and every endeavor is beiDg made by the Forest Service to\nopen hitherto inaccessible ranges by the construction of trails and\nbridges, and unused arid ranges by the development of water. In\nthese higher elevations the grass is usually much finer iu quality\nand more nutritious, while the climate is much more rigorous; both\nof which conditions result iu the animals being in better healtb\nand having more solid flesh when placed on the feeder markets iu\nthe Fall. This Fall has Been latge numbers of the range bred\nsteers, most of which come from ranges within National Forests,\ntopping the feeder markets at al points where feeder steers are\nsold.\nSo great has become the demand for cattle of the quality men\ntioned that hundreds of stockmen throughout the West are selling\ntheir bunches of cattle and are beginning to handle steers exclu\nsively. On the old ranges where t few years ago one was accus\ntomed to see large herds of cows artf calves, you will find to-day\nequally large bunches made up <^tiroly of steers, some of which\nmay perhaps have come from Old Mexico, some from Texas, while\nArizona and New Mexico usually furnish their quota. These\nsteers are brought into these Westqju ranges at from 18 months to\naU TKnj* Ivra^nao a/ml i(L 4. A p } *wk in\nthe second and third years they become sufficiently mature so that\nthey may be taken to market.\nThe demand for cattle of this kind is greater than the supply,\nand as in all other cases where the demand is greater than the sup\nply the price received on sale must constantly increase. That this\nis true of the steer business, one can easily ascertain through con\nversation with any one of the Western stockmen who make this a\nbusiness. They will tell you that they have made more money in\nthe last two or three years in handling steers than they made in 10\nyears in handling strictly stock cattle.\n• Valuable Mineral Discoveries\nIn no business is there so large an element of chance as in min\ning, and the story of the lucky accidents and the peculiar circumstances\nwhich have led to the discovery of bonanza mines, or the finding of\nvaluable minerals in unsuspected places, would make a volume of ro\nmance as fascinating as any fairy tale. In Percy F. Martin’s book,\n“Through Five Republics of South America,” is related the story of\nthe discovery of the monazite sands in Brazil. One John Gordon,\nan Englishman, with some general knowledge of economic min\nerals, was walking disconsolately one day upon the sands at Bahia\nwhile waiting for a boat to take him to the steamer. He noticed\nthat the sand was exceedingly heavy and apparently not of the ordin\nary kind. Curiosity as well as foresight led him to fill his pockets\nwith the material, which he took home with him, and upon analysis\nfound it contained monazite, the source of thorium which is used in\nmaking incandescent gas light mantels, and is valuable. Mr. Gor\ndon succeeded in making a substantial fortune out of his discovery\nand started an important industry, which has added not inconsider\nably to the wealth of Brazil. In this connection it should be men\ntioned also that the material was exported, free of duty, and was a\nsource of great profit to the operators, but recently the Brazilian\nGovernment has imposed a comparatively high export duty on mon\n*»te, thereby curtailing individual profits.\nThis incident in the romance of mining is not dissimilar to the\nstory of the discovery of tungsten in Boulder County, Colorado.\nThe wolframite had been familiar to the early gold miners in this sec\ntion, who supposed that it was, as they called it, “heavy iron.’ About\nsix years ago a couple of observing mining men, who had seen this\nore of tungsten in Arizona, investigated the Colorado “heavy iron\ndeposits and started an industry, which now produces nearly $500,\n000 annually of what was originally ignominiously cast aside. Re\ncently another similar story was developed in connection with a\nMexican mine. A property in Coahuila, which had been a source\nof supply of lead ore for one of the smelters, had been abandoned\n•* exhausted. A prospector secured a lease at very easy terms on\nit and at once proceeded to mine many tons of zinc silicate from\nthe abandoned workings. This product had been entirely over\nlooked by the former operators.\n•Loese incidents serve to show the necessity of intelligent ana\nthorough investigation in connection with every occurrence of miu\n®ral, particularly at this time, when there is a market at high prices\nfor many minerals not ordinarily mined, and with which mining\n»en generally and often trained engineers are unfamiliar. The\n*8gregate product of the rare minerals in western l uited States\namount to several million dollars annually and many of the now\nprofitable deposits have lain idle for years until some intelligently\n«®nous man utilized them.\nNew Wheat For The And Region\nA now grain for feeding purposes and an improved alfalfa tbat\nwill add $200,000,000 to Uncle Sam’s crop values will be submitted\nat the meeting of the American Breeders\' Association in Omaha\nand later to the American Association for the advancement of\nScience, in Boston, by Prof. B. C Buffum, for 15 years head of the\nagricultural department of the University of Wyoming, who left\nChicago to exhibit the finish results of a series of experiments iD\ngrasses and grains secured at the experiment farm under his\nsupervision at Worland, Wyoming.\nThe feeding grain is a new variety of ember, a hybrid wheat,\nwhich is superior to corn in bone nourishment and flesh producing\npowder, and yields from 80 to 150 bushels per acre, or about double\nthe best Russian spelts. It is a beardless wheat of large size and\nfixed hull, especially fitted to production in the arid, semi-arid or\nirrigated country west of the 100 meridian, including all the ele\nvated plateau of the Rocky Mountains and the valleys of the\nmountain ranges. This region, from the Oulf oi Mexico to the\nCauadian boundary, has an average elevation too great for the\nmaturing of corn. Stock raising of all kinds is still the dominant\ninterest throughout the whole of it, and the discovery of this new\nfeed grain promises to relieve the stockmen from the cost and\ntrouble of importing corn from the middle Western States for use\nin fattening or finishing their animals for market This will mean\nan almost incalculable economy iu all branches of auimal husband\nry, and a corresponding increase in profits.—Ogden Examiner.\n^lismated, Evidently\nMrs. Lysamler John Appleton of Kansas has onr fall sympa\nthy. She writes to the Atchison Globe: “If there is any woman\nin this town, or in any other, who sees her affinity in my husband,\nthis is to notify her that she can have him by calling at my home,\n‘The Hilltop,’ Atchison, Kansas, at any hour she may choose.”\nThen she prefers an indictment against him: “ He grumbles\nat his meals; he blows his nose in the grate, puts bis feet on the\nparlor chairs and his head on the parlor cushions; he tells callers\nthat his father was a poor man, that he never had any schooling;\nhe contradicts my statements when I tell of my kinship to real\nprominent people, and if I do not watch him he visits with the\nhired man and wants to ask the milkman in to dinner. If there is\nany woman who sees her affinity in him, let her hang around my\nhouse a few minutes while I ask him for Christmas money, then let\nher take him away if she still wants him.”\nIt evidently would be a relief to the lady to have some one pick\nup that husband and pack him off, and people of some experience\ncan well believe it would be a great relief to him. A good many\npeople are mismated in this world. It would be curious to see\nwhat would happen \'f.sowo woman should make an application\nfor that especial liusbantf, because there have been women who,\nafter a trial of that kind, have decided that “these infernal men\n_there is no getting along with them or without them.”\nNo person of delicacy will borrow a coffee sack to hang up in\nplace of his stocking and fool Santa.\nJAMES A.

ELLEN TYLER, Lessee\nEUREKA, NEVADA\nNEVADA PRESS COMMENT\nRailroad Taxation In Ntvada\nWyoming laze* the Union Paoifio\nRailroad on a valuation of $50,000* mile.\nThis road ia only a link in the Harriman\nsystem, the tame as the Southern Pa\ncific in Nevada. If one link in the\nchain is taxed at $50,003 a mile, is there\nany good reason why Nevada\'s State\nBoard of Assessors should assess an\nequally valuable link at $18,500 per mile,\nas was done last year.\nIf the assessment of the Southern\nPacific Railroad through Nevada ia not\nraised to something near $80,000 per\nmile, the people will have a right to\nlook with suspicion upon the votes cast\nby their Assessors. They most choose\nbetween serving the people or the rail\nroad company.\nir ttiey serve the people instead of the\nrailroad companies they will place a\nreasonable valuation on every mile of\nrailroad track in this State, thus com\npelling these corporations to pay a jnst\nproportion of the expense of the State\nand ooonty governments. If on the\nother hand, they plaoe eervioe to the\ncorporations above their dnty to the\npeople, enough of them will line up on\nthe side of the Southern Pacific Railroad\nCompany to prevent a just and equit\nable assessment of its property.\nThe State Board of Assessors will\nmeet at Carson the first week in January\nto fix the taxable valuation of all prop\nerty in Nevada. Governor Diokerson,\nchairman of the board, will ask its mem\nbers to fix the valuation of the Southern\nPacific Railroad at $30,000 per mile on\nit main track. This is not an unreason\nable figure as the sworn evidence of the\ncompany\'s officials dearly shows. If\nthe Southern Pacific track across this\nState is worth $132,000 a mile when\nrates to rob the pnblio are to be fixed, it\nis certainly worth $30,000 per mile for\ntaxable purposes.\nThat is the way the situation sizes up\nto a large majority of the taxpayers of\nthe State, but how it will appear to the\nState Board of Assessors can not be told\nnntil their votes are recorded. When\nthe record is made, we hope Elko Coun\nty’s Assessor will be on the side of the\npeople. If it is, dne credit will be\ngiven. If it is not, he will have to bear\nthe criticism that will snrely follow.—\nElko Independent.\nPROFESSIONAL CAR 08.\nJ. STOWE SPENCER E. M\nASSAYED AND SURVEYOR\nEUBEKA. NEVADA\nJ.

The result was that the Doctor concluded that to burn\nthem would be for the best, and such was the order given.\nMany people who heard the report were doubters, but last\nnight the announcement was made from the stage of the opera\nhouse to at least 800 people that this morning at 8 o’clock {he\norder would be given to touch a match to his stock in the name of\nthe Lord.\nNotwithstanding th6 early hour many people gathered in front\nof the Joe Kelly store to watch the proceedings, but were disap\npointed as Dr. Yoakum and his associates stated that the act would\nbe pulled off at 1 o’clock this afternoon.\nIn the meantime Joe Kelley was busily engaged breaking out\nthe heads of his barrels of whisky, wines and brandy and pouring\nin hundreds of pounds of all kinds of tobacco and cigars and get\nting all in readiness for their removal to the vacant lot in front of\nArnold Millard’s plumbing establishment across the street.\nBy 1 o’clock several hundred people had gathered there to\nwatch the burning of this valuable assortment of goods, and while\nwaiting the arrival of the man under whose supervision the services\nwere to be held expressed their various opinions regarding the good\nand the bad of the act soon to be performed, in the name of the\nLord.\nThey had not long to wait for soon the carriage containing Dr.\nYoaknm, Sister Minnie and Sister Lulu arrived and were closely\nfollowed by other associates of this man who has created the great\nest revival meeting in Carson City that has ever been recorded in\nthe State of Nevada.\nDr. Yoaknm looked over the pile of what is termed “tools of\nthe Devil” and said all was well. He then mounted a whisky barrel\nand addressed the gathering. He read from the bible passages re\nferring to the act about to be performed. Told of the facts that\nled up to the demonstration and requested that the people open a\nplace that the photographers might have a chance to take a clear\npicture of the articles to be destroyed and the gathering of people\nthat had been called there, some through curiosity and some with\nthe earnest conviction that right was to prevail, at least in this in\nstance.\nAfter addressing the people he took from his pocket an inven\nI tory of the goods before him, given to him by Joe Kelley for the\npurpose of destroying and billed to “Mr. F. E. Yoakum, to burn\nfor the Lord.”\nThe Doctor read the inventory, which was as follows: Fifteen\nhariftU nf liquor. 13 barrels of bottle goods, one can alcohol—5 gal\nlons, one barret of cigars, 89 boxes of tobacco, three sacks of to\nbacco feaob of which contained an assortment of all kinds) and 90\ndozen pipes. The estimated value of this invent ry is placed at\nabout $1700, cost price.\nFollowing the reading of this inventory Dr. Yoakum again read\nfrom the bible quoting passages referring to an action like the one\nabout to be performed and then, addressing Joe Kelley, said:\nBrother Kelley, I will touch a match to this side and you can at\ntend to the other side, and in the name of the Lord we will destroy\n| these objects of iniquity.”\nThe flames lapped up the alcoholic mixture with a vengence\nand in practically a few minutes nothing remained of $1700 worth\nof licensed goods but a few ashes, and they told a mute story of\nthe result of a religious movement that had reached the fanatical\nstage.\nFrom all sides one hears a variance of opinion expressed re\ngarding the demonstration of to-day. It seems that no two agree,\nbut all give to this man who has come amongst us due credit for\nthe good he has performed as regards the healing of the lame, the\nsick, the cripples, the drunkards and those addicted to the use\nof tobaccos.\nState News From Exchanges\nThe Bank of Pioche last weak declaret\na six per cent semi-annual dividend.\nBecause Publio Administrator Jamei\nLemoine of Lincoln County neglected\nto furnish an additional bond of $6000\nthe Commissioners have ousted bin\nfrom office.\nThe Carson News has announced tin\nengagement of District Attorney George\nSanford of Carson and Mias Sweeney\nsister of Supreme Judge James Sweeney\nThey will be married at Carson Decern\nber 23.\nDr. Yoakum, who heals tbe sick and\nmakes tbe cripple walk by prayer aud\nlaying on of hands, is creating great ex\ncitement in Carson.

Each of\nthe calendar* ha* an artistic picture.\nThe one from the Enreka County\nBank has a scene entitled, "Just * Song\nat Twilight.” Through the window\neifte the peaceful blue light of dusk;\nfrom the grate pours the bright radiance\nof the Ore—twilight and fire light meet\non the soft white gown of the ledy at\nthe piano. Her face is veiled in shadow;\nwhile the meditative features of the\nfather and the face of the sleeping child\nare illumined by the fire. The room is\nOiled with soft contrasts and warm\nshadows—twilight and flrelight com\nbine to give that peculiar effect of\nmyatery and soberness that marks the\ntwilight hour. And this the painter\nuses to suggest the spirit of peace and\nsolemn joy within the sonls of the man\nand woman, to whom the years with\ntheir duties and responsibilities have re\nvealed the wider and deeper meaning in\n"Love’s Old, Sweet Song.”\nThe other calendar from the Witten\nberg Warehouse and Transfer Com\npany of Tonopah, Nevada, presents a\npicture entitled, “The Chnrch Where\nShakespeare Sleeps.”\nlime ttsell baa fallen to sleep in this\nancient place. Tbe low aob of the or\ngan only deepeus tbe awfnl sense of i\'s\nsilence and of its dreamless repose.\nBeeches and elms grow over tbe church\nyard, aud many a low tomb and many\na leaning atone are there in tbe shadow,\ngray with moss and mouldering with\nyears. Birds have built their neats in\nmany crevice* in the time worn tower,\nround which at sunset you may see\nthem circle, with chirp of greeting or\nwith call of anxious discontent.\nFrom the Eureka Oash Store is an\nequally handsome calendar, at the top\nof which is a picture cf a young lady\nstanding at tbe head of a thoroughbred\nhorse, and is entitled "In Old Ken\ntucky."\nTbe splendid Kentucky thoroughbred\nhas trotted np to the pasture’* edge at\ntbe call of his mistress, and stands\nwaiting expectantly for tbe lamp of\nsugar he knows he will get. Bat the\nlady teases him a moment, hiding the\nwhite lump behind the brim of her hat\nto tempt him to walk around and find it.\nExtending bis fine, soft, gray nostrils,\ntbe aDimal gives the peculiar, short\nsnort, by which a horse expresses his\nrequest to be fed. No more evidence is\nneeded than the expression of pride and\naffection with which tbe girl looks np\ninto tbe face of her dumb friend, to\nprove that this animal is the family’s\npet, whose intelligence and fine breed\ning they love to exhibit and boast about.\nTo Locate it Ely\nEly Reoord: Walter H.
