Bai\xad\nler\'s retreat as described in the dispatch\nfrom the Boer Head Laager, Ladysmith,\nFeb. 8. When shown the Boer dispatch\nthe officials appeared utterly dumb\xad\nfounded. Apparently they had not the\nleast suspicion of the possibility of such\nan outcome of the operations.\nIt is reported here that General Bul\nler\'s dispatch announcing Monday and\nTuesday\'s movement was particularly\nhopeful. He announced the position\ngained as exceptionably effective, and\ntherefore the news of the retreat is par\xad\nticularly bitter. Though it comes from\nBoer sources there is little reason to dis\xad\ncredit it. The news spread rapidly and\nnaturally disappointment was visible on\nall sides, though the long silence on the\nupper Tugela had already aroused ap\xad\nprehension that Genaral Buller might\nhave found it impossible to go forward,\nin which case he would have no option\nbut to recross the Tugela.\nKOODOESBERG DRIFT, Thursday, Feb.\n8.—In order to completely surround the\nBoers, General Babington was dis\xad\npatched from the Modder river with a\nlarge force of cavalry and two batteries\nof horse artillery but failed to reach\nhere, although he started early enough\nin the day to enable him to get here\nearly this afternoon. This morning\nGeneral Methuen ordered that the com\xad\nbined force should retire upon Modder\nriver, which movement is now proceed\xad\ning. The British losses in the fighting\non Monday were 50 men lrillprl or\nwounded.\nLONDON, Feb. 10.—The dispatch from\nKoodoesburg drift does not say whether\nGeneral Babington finally joined Gen\xad\neral MacDonald, but the word "com\xad\nbined" seems to indicate that he did so.\nBRITISH WERE APPREHENSIVE.\nEarly Reports Expressed Fear For Bai\xad\nlor\'s Forces.\nLONDON, Feb. 10.-2:85 p. m.—There\nis still no news of General Buller\'s do\xad\ning for the past two days. A dispatch\ndated Frere Camp, Thursday, Feb. 8,\nbut probably written with the advanced\nlines Wednesdy, Feb. 7, and sent to\nFrere by runner, says:\n"The forces of the enemy are on both\nour flanks and continue to render our\nposition extremely difficult to main\xad\ntain."\nBeyond the fact that General Buller\ndevoted Wednesday to bringing more\nartillery and troops across the Tugela,\nnothing is known of his movements,\nbut that he badly needed reinforcements\nis evident from the foregoing from\nFrere. It is still more patent that it is\nimpossible for him to advance\nuntil the artillery has\' been\nenabled to take up forward positions\nfor the purpose of subduing the Boer\nguns on both flanks. Upon the length\nof time occupied in this operation de\xad\npends the duration of General Buller\'s\nmaintenance of the defensive. It is\nreasonable to suppose that guns and re\xad\ninforcements were in position yesterday\nand that another attempt to advance is\nnow progressing, or at least that the\nbombardment preliminary to the actual\nmovement of the troops is in progress.\nIn the meanwhile news is awaited with\ngreat eagerness, not unmixed with anx\xad\niety. Almost all the .critics now point\nout that the mere pushing through to\nLadysmith without securing a decisive\nvictory on the way (Here would only add\ndanger to what is |Jready a critics# sit\xad\nuation. \'J I\nTends to Increase Anxiety.\nAnother Frere Oamp dispatch says a\nBoer prisoner asserts that the burghers\nexpected "General Buller to cross at\nSkiot\'s drift and that thousand!? oi\nBoers were being posted at Doni kloof\nto oppose such a passage while on a\'tr.p\ntared hill there were only a few h:ii\nTWENTIETH YEAR. BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, SATURDAY, FEB. 10. 1900\n/I\ndred Johannesburghers. This tends to\nincrease the anxiety of those who be\xad\nlieve that General Buller has scarcely\nbegun the serious part of his advance,\nthough encouragement is gleaned from\nthe news that the heavy naval guns\nafter repeated attempts during which\nthe mules rolled down the hill, have\nsucceeded in reaching the summit of\nZwart\'s kop, whence they are doing ex\xad\ncellent practice.\nGeneral Hector MacDonald\'s retire\xad\nment from Koodoesberg has created\ndisappointment. But the operation\nwas apparently only intended as a\nsortie and its success or failure could\nscarcely have resulted in any material\neffect on the campaign.\nSECOND BAYS BATTLE.\nFighting on Tuesday Much Fiercer Thas\nthe Preceding Day.\nL-ONIMON, Feb. 10.—The Daily Tele\xad\ngraph has received the following dis\npatoh dated Tuesday, Feb. 6, from\nSpearman\'s camp:\n"This is the second day of the battle\nand the fighting has been fiercer than it\nwas yesterday. The Boers began ac\xad\ntion by shelling our bivouacs with their\n•Long Tom\' and Pompon guns from\nDorn kloof. Their 6-inch shells fell\nnear the spot where General Buller and\nhis staff were Watching the engagement.\nOne shell burst amid a squadron of the\nThirteenth Hussars, but not a soul was\ntouched! Our guns on Zwarts kop\nshelled the enemy, but repeatedly the\nBoers brought back their guns, popped\nthem into work over the hills, fired a\nfew rounds and then again changed\ntheir position.\nAmmunition Wagon Blown Up.\n"During the morning our guns suc\xad\nceeded in blowing up the enemy\'s am\xad\nmunition wagon on Dooms kloof. Gen\xad\neral Lyttleton\'s brigade was shot at\nfrom three sides and had a warm time\nupon Vaai Krantz.\n"Desperate efforts were made by the\nBoers to retake the smoking hiU. The\nDurban light infantry, the King\'s royal\nrifles and the Scottish rifles gallantly\ncharged and cleared the position.\n"General Hildyard\'s brigade relieved\nGeneral Lyttleton\'s brigade towards\nsunset. Fighting continued until 9.\nSeveral prisoners have been taken. They\nsay the Boers yesterday lost heavily.\nThe enemy suffered severely today. It\nis reported that among their dead in the\ntrenches armed Kaffirs were found."\nDRIVEN BACK BY BOERS.\nArmored Train Stakes a Sortie From\nChieveley Toward Colenso.\nHEAD LAAGER, Ladysmith, Wednes\xad\nday, Feb. 7.—A11 armored train yester\xad\nday made a sortie from Ohieveley to\xad\nwards Colenso, and landed 2,000 British\ntroops on the right of the Boer position.\nThe Boers immediately crossed the\nriver and made an attack with rifles and\nartillery, forcing the withdrawal of both\nthe train and the troops to Chievely.\nThe fighting on the Upper Tugela\nriver lasted until 8:30 o\'clock yesterday\n(Tuesday) evening. Particulars are\nlacking. Firing at Colenso and along\nthe Upper Tagula has been proceeding\nsince 5 o\'clock this morning.\nPlumer Also Kepulsed.\nPRETORIA, Monday, Feb. 5.—Colonel\nPlumer\'s force, Feb. 2, attacked the\nBoer position near Ramonsts and after\nheavy fighting, including an endeavor\nto take the place by storm, the British\nwere repulsed. Their loss is unknown.\nNo Boers were injured.\nONE BANDIT LESS.\nAttejnpt to Hold Up a Chicago Saloon\nResults Fatally.\nCHICAGO, Feb. 10.—A lone robber,\nwell dressed, with money in his pockets\nand with a ribbed silk mask to cover up\nhis features, was shot and killed C. H.\nWoerner\'s Park Pavilion, 1859 West\nMadison street, by Frank Barum, an\nOak Park lawyer and Edward\' Sommer\nfeldt, the barkeeper.\nBesides Somrnerfeldtand Barum there\nwas only one other person in the saloon\nwhen the robber entered. The robber\ncommanded them to throw up theii\nhands. Resistance was offered and in\nthe struggle the robber firod twice, at\nhis victims, one of the bullets taking ef\xad\nfect in Sommerfeldt\'s arm. Barum\nthen managed to\' wrench the revolver\nfrom the robber. Sommerfeldt in the\nmeantime had secured his revolver and\nboth he and Barum fired several shots\nat the robber, who fell dead at their feet.\nThe police were notified, and the body\nof the hold-up man was removed to the\nmorgue. In the pockets of the dead\nman were found $165. Barum anc*\nSommerfeldt were not arrested.\nMAY HAVE FOUNDERED.\nFears for Hie Safety of a Big Knssian\nDredger and Crew.\nLONDON, Feb. 10.—The new Russian\nsteam driedger Devolant, which left the\nClyde Dec. 1, for Odessa, is overdue and\nhas been given up as lost. It is sur\xad\nmised that she foundered in the chan\xad\nnel. There were 189 persons on board\nthe Devolant.\nMore Union Won XfOcked Oat.\nCHICAGO, Feb. 10.—More union men\nwere let out by the big contractors dur\nipg the day because they refused to\nwork under the new rules. It is\nby the contractors that 75 per oent of\nthe men who were working a week ago\nare now idle.\nf-\nNO NEEDTO FEAR\nBeckham Assures Democratic\nLegislators Who Come\nto Louisville\nThat They Need Have No Fear\nof Arrest—He Will Not\nPermit It.\nGeneral Meeting of Republicans\nat Frankfort to Consider\nSituation.\nLOCISVILLE, Ky., Feb. 10.—Governoi\nBeckham has made the following state\xad\nment:\n"No member of the legislature whe\ncomes to Louisville need fear arrest. 1\nshall not allow members of the general\nassembly to be arrested."\nGovernor Beckham said that he was\nfully prepared to protect the legislature\nand to prevent the arrest any legislator.\nREPUBLICAN CONFERENCE.\nGathering at Frankfort to Consider the\nLouisville "Peace Agreement."\nFRANKFORT, Ky.,Feb. 10.—It is likely\nthat a general meeting of Republicans\nwill be held here in the morning to con\xad\nsider the peace agreement as adopted at\nLouisville. For a week past Governoi\nTaylor has been receiving telegrams by\nthe hundreds from all parts of the state\nurging him to stand firm and not to sur\xad\nrender anything. The impression has\nbecome prevalent among Republicans\nwho were not parties to the agreement\nthat the compact was a- complete sur\xad\nrender to the Democrats. Gentlemen\nwho signed the agreement for the Re\xad\npublicans do not so consider it, and\nhave said all along that when the text\nof the agreement was published in full\nit would be understood by the balance\nof the party that they had not delivered\nthe party over to the enemy.\nGovernor Taylor has been in a very\ndiflicult position, owing to the pressure\nbrought to bear upon him from those\noutside sources, and has not thought it\nwise to make any statetnent regarding\nhis intention until he could convince\nthe party that anything he might dc\nwould be for its good.\nHe has therefore sent a large numbei\nof telegrams to all of the gentlemen whe\nSave for the last five days showered him\nwith advice to come to Frankfort. What\nhis intentions are is not known, and he\nwill say nothing regarding them. It is\nannounced, however, from a source a\nlittle less authorative than the governoi\n.himself, that he desires to hear the ob\xad\njections they have to the agreement.\nIn many cases the telegrams the gov\xad\nernor has received have had from two\nto six signatures, and when such was\nthe case the governor has asked the\nsigners to come to Frankfort at once.\nTwo More Goebel Suspects.\nFRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 10.—Two men\nsuspected of complicity in the murder\nof Governor Goebel were arrested in a\nboarding house heie. The names are\nSilas Jones of Whittley county, and\nGottschalk of Nelson county. Both\nstrongly deny any knowledge of the\nmurder.\nTaylor Was Not Represented.\nGEORGETOWN, Ky., Feb. 10.—Gov\xad\nernor Taylor was not represented when\nJudge Cantrill called the injunction\nproceedings here. On request of Judge\nPryor for the plaintiffs, the hearing was\npostponed until Tuesday next.\nBRITISH NAVAL DEFECTS.\nOne-third of England\'s First Class Vessels\nAriued With Muzzle Loaders.\nLONDON, Feb. 10.—Since the war has\nstrained the resources of the military\nsystem Englishmen have been troubled\nby the possibility that sea fightimg\nmight show naval defects which would\nweaken the first line of defense in\nwhich the country has placed such\ncomplete trust. This apprehension has\nsuddenly found expression. During the\nlast two or three days in half the news\xad\npapers in England the government\'s at\xad\ntention has been especially directed *o\n.muzzle loading guns. Even the pub1\nhas been painfully surprised to learn\nthat sixteen battleships and eight a-\nmored cruisers depend upon muzzle\nloaders. This means that smaller but\nfaster ships with modern guns would be\nable to stand 1,000 or 2,000 yards out of\nrange and disable in leisurely fashion\nabout one-third of the vessels which ap\xad\npear in the naval list as "first class."\nThe admiralty is understood to be pre\xad\nparing to remedy this defect.\nDISCUSSED HAWAII.\nSituation Created by the Plague Occupied\nthe Cabinet Session.\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 10.—The cabinet\nheld but a short session in order to at\xad\ntend the funeral services of General\nLawton.\nThe principal subject of discussion\nwas the plague situation in Hawaii. It\nwas pointed out that the necessities oi\nthe case required the destruction of a\nlarge number of buildings in the poor\nquarter of the city of Honolulu, and\nHi\nthat consequence, many ot tbe na\xad\ntives are homeless and in a destitute\ncondition. Apparently there is no legis\xad\nlative authority to meet the situation\nby the appointment of funds for the re\xad\nlief of those in distress, and it is under\xad\nstood to be the purpose of President Mc\nKinley to communicate the facts to con\xad\ngress with a request for authority to re\xad\nconvene the old legislature or to estab\xad\nlish a commission with power to do\nwhatever is needful at this time.\nSerious Chinese Rebellion.\nLONDON, Feb. 10.—The Hong Kong\ncorrespondent of The Daily Mail says\nserious rebellion has broken out in\nSwatu, in the province of Kweng Tung.\nVERY FEW RECOVER.\nOf Forty-six Cases of Bubonic Plague at\nflinolulu Forty Were Fatal.\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 10.—Surgeon Gen\xad\neral Sternberg has received a communi\xad\ncation from Major Blair D. Taylor at\nHonolulu showing the great fatality\nfrom the bubonic plague at that point\nand the great distress caused to the pop\xad\nulation by the destruction of a large\npart of the Chinese district by fire. His\nreport is dated Jan. 22 and says that up\nto date there has been 46 cases of bu\xad\nbonic plague with 40 deaths.*\n"The whole town," says Major Tay\xad\nlor, "has been districted and each per\xad\nson is inspected twice a day. On the\n20th, while burning a part of China\xad\ntown, the fire got away and destroyed\nnearly the whole of the district, render^\ning almost 4,000 Asiatics and natives\nhomeless. These people are now cor\xad\nralled in different places under guard\nand are being fed at public expense. It\nis feared, however, that many of them\ngot away in the confusion with such of\ntheir household goods as they could\ncarry and may spread the infection far\nand wide."\nREMARKABLE MAN GONE.\nColonel Richard W, Thompson Dies at\nTerre Haute, Ind.\nINDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 10. A special\nfrom Terre Haute, Ind., says that\nColonel Richard W. Thompson died at\nhis residence there at 1:11 Friday morn\xad\ning. He had been unconsious for more\nthan 24 hours, only occasionally awak\xad\nening from the lethargy and failing to\nrecognize any one, or if he did so he\nfailed to make any indication. The end\nwas peaceful. There was no sign of\nstruggle or any suffering apparent. At\nhis beside was Dr. Roberts, Mrs. Myrick,\na daughter,* and Miss Thompson, an\xad\nother daughter, the younger son, Harry,\nand some distant relatives from Rock\nville, Ind. The oldest son, Richard\nThompson, resides in Marshall, Tex.,\nand failed to arrive.\nWINNIPEG TO ST. PAUL.\nProposal to Connect the Manitoba and\nMinnesota Capitals by Water.\nFARGO, N. D., Feb. 10.—It is an\xad\nnounced that the tri-state drainage canal\ncommittee will meet in Fargo Feb. 21.\nDelegates from all the towns along the\nRed river are to be present, and it is\nproposed to open up a navigable water\xad\nway from Lake Winnipeg to the Mis\xad\nsissippi river at St. Paul, by way of the\nMinnesota river. To accomplish this,\nreservoirs will be established at Big\nStone and Traverse lakes, with a canal\nbetween the lakes and to the Minnesota\nriver. This would make a waterway\n900 miles long and would prove valuable\nto the towns and country situated\nthereon.\nMAY BE ABANDONED.\nEfforts to Arrange Reciprocity Treaties\'\nUnder the Dingley Act.\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 10.—Before pro\xad\nceeding further with the construction of\nnew reciprocity treaties the state depart\xad\nment will await the action of the senate\nupon the pending French treaty. Should\nthat fail all efforts to affect the reci\xad\nprocity scheme as contained in the\nDingley act will be abandoned. It is\nprobable, too, that in the event of the\ncontinuance of the negotiations another\nplenipotentiary must be found on the\npart of our government to take part of\nthe heavy work that has fallen to the\nshare of Mr. Kasson.\nTROUBLE IN MARTINIQUE.\nMob of Miners Prevents Harvesting of\nCase—Nine Men Killed.\nFORT DE FRANCE, Martinique, Feb.\n10.—(Via Haitien cable.)—A mob of\nabout 1,200 miners has since Monday\nlast been preventing the harvesting of\nsugar cane. The movement is extend\xad\ning and troops have been sent in all di\xad\nrections.\nAn infantry post of 25 men was at\xad\ntacked and fired on its assailants, kill\xad\ning 9 men and wounding 14.\nIn the commune of Le Francois, two\nincendiary fires have occurred on plan\xad\ntations.\nWeyeThauser Lumber Company.\nTACOMA, Wash., Feb. 10—The Weyer\nhauser syndicate, which purchased yo j,\n000 acres of timber land from the North\xad\nern Pacific three months ago, met her\nand elected the following officers: Fred\n„erick Weyerhauser, St. Paul, president\nand treasurer W.

Lawton has been buried in.\nthe National cemetery at Arlington.\nThe services at the grave were preceded,\nby those at the church of the Covenant*\nin this city, where President H. M-.\nStryker of Hamilton college, New York*\ndelivered a funeral oration that has\nseldom been equaled in beauty of ex\xad\npression, nor could it have been in more\nperfect accord with the spirit of the\nsolemn occasion that called it forth.\nNever in the history of the capital has\nthere been a more representative gath\xad\nering of the nation\'s official life to pay\na last tribute to the nation\'s honored,\ndead. No mark of military pomp and\nceremony that the regulations could\nprovide was wanting to render the oc\xad\ncasion solemn and impressive. Nearly\nall the available troops of the .regular\nestablishment remaining in this coun\xad\ntry were called out. Three thousand\nmen, infantry, cavalry and artillery,\nfollowed the flag-draped caisson to the.\ngraye. But mere official formulae were.,\ndwarf ted beside the\nPopular Demonstration\nthat the burial of the dead soldier called\nforth. Every department of the govern\xad\nment paid its official tribute. Flags,\nhung at half-mast.

It was in\ntribute to this soldier\'s ideal that the\nAmerican generosity had for weeks past\nswelled "the Lawton fund" beyond all\nexpectations of its originators, and in\nfurther tribute today that the great out\xad\npouring of citizens filled the streets long\nbefore the hour when the services at the\nChurch of the Covenant were to com\xad\nmence over the hero whose remains had\nlain in state under military guard\nthrough the silent watches of the night.\nSHOULD NOT BE RATIFIED.\nAuthor of the Nicaraguan Canal Bill Op\xad\nposes the Kew Treaty.\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 10.—Representa\xad\ntive Hepburn, chairman of the hpuse in\xad\nterstate and foreign commerce commit\xad\ntee, which has charge of the Nicaraguan\ncanal appropriation bill, opposes the\ncanal treaty with Great Britain now\npending in the senate.\n"I think," he said, "the negotiating\nof this treaty is very unfortunate and\nthat it ought not to be ratified by the\nsenate.

Fargo is likely to result in an\ninvestiiigatiprb by the government of the\nmethods in vogue for bringing China\xad\nmen into the country in violation of\nthe esdusionj act, and a change in the\n•present system, of identification at\n-poets of entry. In passing upon the\ncases ait Faxgo, Judge Aimidon said\nThe records that have been made in\nthese caises showing the scope of the\ninvestigation is a matter that reflects\ngreat credit on the district attorney\n•and upon the agents of the treasury\n•department who (have assisted hikn.\nI It was a very difficult investigation to\nscarry out, owling to tie lack of kno\'wfl\ni&lfee of the people, as to their \'custodts\niaaid practices, and also the mysterious\nsimaiairftty of their names. I believe\nthe prosecotioin must result in great\n-bellefit to an honest ansd impartial ad\xad\nministration of the Chinese Exclusion\nact. The records which have been\nmade in these cases leave no doubt\nwhatever that a system carefully pre\npared iby leading spirits—of importflng\n§1^ CJMnese persons tmlawfuily. into tlie\nUnited Staites hlas been in vo®ue in the\n*cftty of Chicago.\nIn order to axtoit a Chinaman, it\nmust be shown, that he is a merchant,\nS and in order to give a mercantile status\nto CttKtnamen stores with trifling\nstock have been opened, and these peo\xad\nple are taken in as apparent partners\nin these firms, for the purpose of get\nting them into the United States, and\nnot for the purpose of carrying on any\nlegitimate mercantile enterprise. There\niis clear e^demce, I think, that in many\ncases ,same oif the head men of these\nyconcerns have been parties to this un\xad\nlawful practice, and dt seems to me,\nalthough the evidence is not such as\none would, proncrance judgment upon,\nperhaps, that the real nature of these\nsoma which the Chinamen have pAi/t\n:?into these firms nominally as partners\nhave In fact been the price of securing\n& thefa* admission into the United States,\ni\' and fhtattlie parties interested in these\n\'Kmeerns have simply taken the money\nVi and turned the Chinamen loose. That\nis the way it looks to me, upon the\n-records that have fteen introduced in\nevidence.\nI migtot repeat at this time wfttat I\nShave already said in other cases, that\nif. I thtak it is the duty Of the department\nof Hhe government having the admSn\nfetradaon of tSJs Chinese exclusion act\nto charge to promulgate some regn&a-\nHons by which Chinamen leaving ttfe\n_.«• country, Who are entitled under the act\nto tbottr, may estatWeh their right by\nii4\' heastog before -they go, whfich wffll\nAwful Itching of Eczema\nDreadful Scaling of\n9aji|PsorfesIs\nCURED fev CtmCURA\n3®fc*cpjM, Soap, to eleaasejhe skin\n^^8caJe8\' Cimctm* Ointment, to\n•Hay itdrfnp, and soothe Mad heal, add\natUot.rmtn, to cotA and cleanaa\nw» tfae moet ramptato and\n5P®®dy euro tm&tpmk tot torturing, dip*\nof tha best physicioaa aad aUrtttMrWufe*\nCUnajRATHESET$1.2S\n*eb soubh\nfwiros\nih^sns^\nbe received by tfhe collectors of tihe\nports, as entitling them to adlmission\ninto the United States, and which\nshouild only \'be open .to attach upon the\nground that it \'was obtained by fraud.\nThese people have been subjected\nto a very great \'hardship. The expense\nof conducting this litigation on their\npart have been grea t. They have been\nconfined here—kept froim their busi\xad\nness—and subjected to t^e bifenillation\nof such a proceetdng. It ought not to\nhe necessary to do that. It would be\nvery easy to formulate a regulation\nunder wlik-h such certificates could be\nissued by the special agents of the\ntreasury department, or l,v some other\nofficer, before whom these Chinamen\nwould1 appear lin person, before they\nleft, with their witnesses, and estab\xad\nlish tfheir right to return—have that\nfact certified—that would lie cheap\nand simple, and would not only estab\xad\nlish the right of such per*sons to return,\nbut would naturally in the course of\ntime come to exclude all other persons\nwlio did not lia.ve the certificates.\nSpeaMng of state funds in suspended\nbanks in the staite, tfhe Wahpeton Globe\nsays, Avi\'fch reference to some criticisms\nthat have been passed:\nThese banks suspended during the\ndisastrous period brought about by\ndemocratic mismanagement. The state\nwas supposed to be protected by bonds,\nsigned by men who could pay. It was\nfound, however, that \'the bondsmen\nwere as poor as tihe banks, their assets\nhaving been put in such condition by\nthe democratic financial maelstrom\nthat to attempt to realize upon the\nbonds Avouild be to involve all parties\nin inextricable financial muddles. Men\nwho were good financially when they\nsigned the bonds had become involved,\nand suits to force them to pay would\nhave been expensive and fruitless.\nWhen McK\'inley was elected, the bus\xad\niness of the country was put upon a\nbetter basis, the management of the\nbanks, then \'in the \'hands of receivers,\ncommenced to realize upori the secur\xad\nities, and every little while dividends\nwere declared until at this time more\nthan fifty per cent of the entire amount\nin the \'five suspended banks has been\npaid the state. It is quite likely that\nthe Citizens National of Fargo, and\nthe First National of Pembina will pay\nout entirely, while the Grand Forks\nNational may pay 50 per cent. The\nSecond National of Grand Forks his\nalready paid more than fifty per cent,\nand will pay more. The Minot bank\nis a case where little will be paid by\nthe receiver, and nothing can be col\xad\nlected from the bondsmen.\nDeputy Staite Treasurer Cook fur\nnishes the Globe with the following\nstatement which shows, the amounts\nthai: were in the state depositories at\nthe time of their suspension, and the\namounts that are due:\nCitizens Natl.

Hurst waft\nformer resident of Biisaiarcik and\nMandan and well known among the\nboys beret The account says:\nThe supreme court has affirmed the\njudgment of the lower court-3a two\nmore murder in the first degree cases,\ntlie state agaiinst WiMiam Oalder and\nthe state against Joseph Hurst. Bafcli\nmen will hang unless the governor in\nterfetres. Hurst wasi convicted at\nmiurderung Dominick OavanaugOi in\nDawson county and CaMer of murder\xad\ning Farquahar MciRae in Fergus\ncounty.\nThe evidence in the Hurst case was\ncircumstantial, while that in the Galder\ncase was conclusive. Joseph Hurst\nwas convicted at Glendive, March 21,\nof last year, of mua\'dea-ing Sheriff Caiv\naniaugfh. The dead: body of the sheriff\nwas foauid lying in an aJley near tibje\njaal cm a coM morning in Pecemibejti\n1898. He had been killed by bejng\nbeaten on the neiad wCth a blunt instru\nment, an iron bolt. The doctors who\nhad examined the body said the skuiB\nwas broken in 35 places. The murcje®"\nwas one of the great sensations of the\nday. There appeared to be ik ei_»e.\nOffers of rewaru failed to- locate the\nmurderer. Eastern detectives wtyio\nwent to work on the case finally made\nthe claim that Joseph Hurst was the\nmurderer. He was tried and con\xad\nvicted.\nThe claim was made and the theory\nappears to prevail dn Glendive that\nHuiwt committed the deed in a spirit\nof revenge at Caivanaugh for beating\nliim at the polKs in the race for sheriff\nof Dawson county in November, 1898.\nThe most, damaging witness against\nHurst was a, man by the name of Frank\nGoifemore. Gilmore swore positiv^y\nthat the evening of the murder, about\n8 o\'clock, he was unloading some wood\nand sarw -Cavanaugh. pai^s along. Hujnst\nwas about thirty feet behiind him\ncarrying a paper package. It was a\nclear moonlight night and Gil more says\nhe saw both men very distinctly. He\nwas positive an hlis identification of\nHurst. He recogUized Hurst from\nthe fact that the latter was larger tnan\nOavanangh.\nGilmore\'s evidence was very damag\xad\ning to Hurst, in fa,ct it practioaJHy\nhangs the condemned man. Gil more\ntold a number of different stories.\nWhen he told the last one he claimed\nthat the reason he had not told the\nsame story from the beginning was\nbecause, he was very friendly to Hurst\nand wanted to shield him. Evidence\nwas aflsso introduced as to threats that\nHurst was allege to have made\nagainst Gavanaugu becatise of the\nelection contest. A woman testified\nto having heard Hurst say in conver\xad\nsation with another man about the\nelection: \'"Damn if he\'ll get. it," mean\xad\ning that Oavanaiiigh would not be\nelected. "If the s— of a b— diid, he\nwould never see the new year."\nThis testimony in connection With\nwhat happened to Cavanaugh shortly\nafter election was of course very dam\xad\naging to the accused. Hurst\'s coun\xad\nsel attacked Giihnore\'s testimony, in\nfact questioned a.\'l the evtidence against\nthe man\'.\nThe supreme court says in effect,\nthat it has carefully considered the evi\xad\ndence and it does not feel justified in\npassing upon the credibility of the wit\xad\nnesses. *\'We have given our attention\ncarefully to tfhe evidence." says the\n-onrt, "and cannot sav that the\' result\nreached by the jury was not justified\nby the evidence or that there is a rea\xad\nsonable douibt of the guilt of the de\xad\nfendant." The court Says it cannot\ntry tilie case, that is the province of a\njury. A jury has considered the evi\xad\ndence against Hurst suffident. The\ncourt considered that its duty ended\nWhen after a careful examination of\nthe record it found the evidence suffi\xad\ncient to support the findings of the\njury.\nA greatest danger from colds and la\ngrippe is their resulting in pneumonia.\nIf reasonable care is used, however, and\nChamberlin\'s Cough Remedy taken, all\ndanger is avoided.
