Speaking of an\narticle iu our last issue regarding j„g\nthe success of the plant Mr. Gar- in\nvin said: . Tour article in the\nFree Press is correct and 72 cents \'p.\nwas all that was left in the tailings\nafter six hours treatment and we ager\nwill do even better than that."\nTo say that I am pleased with\nthe camp is putting it mildly.\nTo a man whose part it is to re\ncovet the precious metals Trom the q.\n! ore, no camp is interesting to him chas.\n! unless the values are there, and, was\n!

The succès of this process Geo\nwill do a great deal toward en- G\ncouraging development, not only E\nin the Hump but at Big Creek and j\nother camps when the ore is of a jg\nsimilar nature and requires some- \\\nthing more than a mill to Bave the W\nvalues. j\nT\nPtomaine Poisoning;\nMrs. Leasure, of Moscow, died\nat Lewiston Sunday morning at\nthe home of her daughter, Mrs.\nClay McNainee, on Normal hill,\nthe cause of death being ptomaine\npoisoning.\nThe poisoning it is believed by\nthe physicians came from mutton\nfat that was served for dinner at\nthe McNamee residence on Thurs\nday afternoon, April 14. After\ndinner, Attorney McNamee be\ncame sick, and the symptoms of\nptomaine poisoning—vomiting and\nbowel trouble—were noticed. At\n2 o\'clock the following Friday\nmorning, Mrs. McNamee was sim\nilarly affected and that afternoon\nMrs. Leasure was taken sick. Mrs.\nLeasure was of the Christian\nScience faith and received treat\nment until Sunday, when owing\nto her critical state, Dr. Morris\nwas summoned. He pronounced\nthe case was one of ptomaine pois\noning and latter called into con\nsultation Drs. Phillips and Ster\nling. Every effort was made by\nthe physicians to counteract the\npoison but without success and\nMrs. Leasure, who suffered pa\ntiently, gradually grew weaker to\nthe end.\nThe poisoning in the case of Mr.\nand Mrs. McNainee was not so pro\nnouncad and they are now rapid\nly recovering from their illness.—\nTribune.\nbe\na\n»\nNew Mail Route\nBids will be received by the\npost office department for carrying\nmails on star routes from Florence\nby Knott to Resort and back three\ntimes a week.
