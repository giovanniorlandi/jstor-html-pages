        <pre>['163 \nNATIONAL SUPERANNUATION AND \nSOCIAL INSURANCE BILL \nTHE Sessional Meeting held on 26 January 1970 was devoted to a discus- \nsion on the National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill. \nAn abstract of the evening’s discussion follows: \nMr C. S. S. Lyon, in opening the discussion, said that the actuarial profession could, \nwith a slight stretch of the imagination, be likened to the building trade, since the special \nskills of both were employed alike in construction and demolition. The actuary was \ntrained in the art of forecasting how a future financial liability was likely to emerge and \nof planning the construction of a fund which would enable it to be met. So, too, if there \nwere a fund, or part of one, which had to be taken apart and divided between the \nbeneficiaries, the actuary would say how it could be done equitably. Therefore, they \nowed to no one an apology for discussing a measure which created enormous liabilities \nin the years ahead and which planned to collect and divide a large part of future national \nresources in order to meet them. He was referring, of course, to the National Super- \nannuation and Social Insurance Bill which had recently been published. \nThe Secretary of State had surely been right to remind everyone, when moving its \nsecond reading that: ‘Whatever view one might take about the merits of the Bill, the \nchanges it makes will be tremendously important to ordinary people.’ ‘National Super- \nannuation’, he had complained, ‘has been discussed in the last six months not in the \nhuman terms of its impact on the lives of ordinary people, but in the specialized lingo of \npensioneering.’ The opener thought that was inevitably true of actuaries, and although \nhe could not avoid the ‘lingo’ he was anxious that it should not shut out from their \nthoughts the social needs of their generation. In St Paul’s words: ‘I may prophesy, \nfathom all mysteries and secret lore . . . but if I have no love I count for nothing.’ As if \nthat were not enough, he had recently heard a saying, not of Chairman Mao but of their \npast president, Mr Frank Redington, ‘Actuaries’, he had once told a journalist,‘ were of \ntwo kinds: those who made forecasts and were always wrong, and those who did not \nmake forecasts and were never right.’ For those reasons, he intended to make equity, \nrather than forecasting, his main theme. \nSo many problems of equity were interwoven in the Bill that time would not permit him \nto consider them all. Equity between people who contributed and those who did not or \ncould not contribute; equity among contributors; equity between contributors and tax- \npayers; equity between generations of contributors and taxpayers; equity between \npresent pensioners and those of the future; equity between men and women; equity \nbetween handicapped and able-bodied; equity between industrially and non-industrially \ndisabled; equity between those who were members of occupational schemes and those \nwho were not; equity between contracted-in and contracted-out; equity between em- \nployers with contributory schemes and those with non-contributory schemes; equity \nbetween employed and self-employed—those were some of the problems with which \nactuaries were entitled to be concerned. Like most actuarial problems, they permitted \nof no unique solution, and it was unlikely that there would even be a general consensus \nof actuarial opinion. \nThe object of the Bill was to take a further step in the redistribution of income from \nthose who earned to those who did not. That process was generally similar in nature to \nmany forms of taxation, but there was one vital difference: in return for having part of \n', '164 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \ntheir income redistributed, the earners were promised a specific amount of redistribution \nin their favour whenever they were transferred to the category of those who did not \nearn. It would be unwise to underestimate the importance of that difference. It established \na contract between the community and each contributor and, although the community \ncould improve the terms of the contract at its discretion, it was not easy to worsen them. \nAnyone who doubted that had only to recall the hullaballoo which greeted the recently \ndeclared intention to restrict the unemployment benefit payable to occupational pen- \nsioners who were not yet entitled to their State pension. \nAnother difference which distinguished the contributions under that type of scheme \nfrom a general tax was that they were only payable on earnings up to a ceiling—in the \npresent case roughly 150% of the average earnings of a male industrial worker. There \nwere taxes which were only payable on earnings in excess of some figure—income tax \nand surtax, for example—but who would accept as fair a general tax which ceased to \noperate above a certain limit of earnings? If there had to be a social security tax without \nstrings it would surely have to be applied to all earned, and unearned, income. \nA corollary of that argument was that the contributions to a social security scheme \nshould secure a title to benefits which could be justified by reference to those contribu- \ntions, or to the earnings on which they were levied, without any weighting in favour of a \nparticular band of earnings. But the Bill, by pensioning lower earnings at 60% and middle \nearnings at 25%, contained just such a weighting although contributions were payable \nat 6¾% on both ranges of earnings. Thereby it introduced inequity among contributors \nwhich could be avoided if the Treasury supplement, fixed in the Bill at an arbitrary 18% \nof contributions, were eventually to be increased so that it fully financed the weighting \nas it emerged in new pensions and other benefits. It would be sufficient to regard the \nweighting as the excess over 362/3% of life average earnings—the highest common factor \nfor all contributors. \nIn describing the present Treasury contribution as arbitrary, he was liable to be re- \nminded of the celebrated 12th century Dialogus de scaccario in which the reader was \ntold that ‘the Exchequer has evolved its rules not by hazard, but by the deliberations and \ndecisions of great men’. Nevertheless, he would like to see the philosophy behind the \nTreasury supplement made clear, for he believed it would enable the contributory \nprinciple underlying the Bill to be interpreted with less rigidity. For example, it seemed \nto him quite intolerable in the 1970s to refuse to frank a disabled child into the National \nSuperannuation and Social Insurance Scheme on reaching the age of 16 and to argue that, \nas it was a contributory scheme, he should apply for means-tested benefits from another \nsource. So long as it was made clear to contributors that any benefits which were not \nrelated to contributions were financed through the Treasury supplement he could not see \nthat the inclusion of the disabled 16-year old for a flat rate of benefit would be any more \nobjectionable than the pensioning of certain earnings at 60% instead of 25%. \nExcessive reliance on the contributory principle had also led to an unrealistic formula \nfor calculating the pensions payable on invalidity or on widowhood before the contri- \nbutor reached retirement age. A contributor could be regarded as earning a number of \npension points in each year according to the relationship between his earnings and the \nceiling earnings for the time being. Thus the highest score in any year was one. The life- \ntime average score, multiplied by the ceiling earnings at the date when the pension com- \nmenced, determined the earnings on which the amount of pension was calculated. The \naverage score for an invalidity pension or a pre-retirement widow’s benefit was deter- \nmined after filling in each future year to normal retirement age with a score of only one- \nthird. It was obvious that any invalidity pension or widow’s benefit which began at a \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 165 \nrelatively early age would be based on a very low average. Since the social need was \nlikely to be high in such a case, that method of calculation was hard to defend except on \na rigid interpretation of the contributory principle. Moreover, it was out of line with \ngood practice in occupational schemes. It was true that most invalidity pensions and \nwidow’s benefits would begin in the twilight of working life and would therefore be based \non a more satisfactory average, but if anything that strengthened rather than weakened \nthe argument for more favourable treatment of the younger cases. The position would \nbe improved if life average earnings were calculated for that purpose by regarding work- \ning life as continuing for not more than, say, ten years after the onset of invalidity or \nwidowhood. \nThe short-term social insurance benefits payable during the first 6 months of sickness \nand widowhood did not fit very satisfactorily into the longer-term benefits. For want of a \nbetter solution, the short-term benefits were similar to those payable at present, namely \na flat-rate benefit with an earnings-related supplement. That supplement depended \nentirely on the total of earnings in the last complete fiscal year. In the early years of the \nscheme there would be a substantial fall in benefit at the end of 6 months due to the \ngradual maturity of the longer-term benefits, which would only be payable on the \nnormal formula to people qualifying for them in 1992 or later. By 1992 there would be \nlittle or no fall after 6 months where the benefit became payable late in working life, \nbut there would still be a big drop where it became payable early in working life—for the \nreason he had already explained. There was inequity there, and his personal judgment \nwas that the pre-retirement sickness and widowhood benefits were more of a patchwork \nquilt than ever. \nShort-term sickness benefits ought in any case to have received radical reconsideration. \nThey had become progressively more expensive, not only because levels of benefit had \nincreased but also because the sickness experience had worsened. The causes were prob- \nably correlated, although he believed that the trend towards higher rates of sickness was \ninternational. He wondered whether it would have been unreasonable to pass to the \nemployer the responsibility for continuing the wages or salary of a sick employee for, say, \nthe first 2 weeks of sickness. A reduction in the employer’s contribution rate could have \nbeen allowed in return, and much administrative cost saved. Again, were sickness benefits \nto continue to be tax-free, and if so, why? It was surely a misuse of national resources to \nallow such benefits to be added to the personal tax allowances which was what effectively \nhappened at present. \nThe opener said that so far he had mainly discussed problems of equity within the \nsame generation. But equally serious problems presented themselves when people looked \nahead to the next generation. In particular there was the dilemma faced by any planner \nwho wished to introduce a new design—namely, what was to be done about existing \ndesigns which could not be fully modified to the new specification. It was surely wrong \nto inhibit future development, but a complete failure to plan reasonable improvements \nto existing structures was likely to lead to severe dissatisfaction. That was how he per- \nsonally viewed the State pension problem, although there were those people who would \nhold back all future progress to a rate which would not outstrip the improvement of \nexisting pensions. He would merely ask those people whether they would regard such a \nphilosophy as appropriate to an occupational scheme, and if not, why not? \nNevertheless, reverting to his Norman dialogue: ‘it happens now and then that what is \nconceived with sound counsel and excellent intent may be the more expeditiously under- \ntaken if funds are available’. Many people had criticized the Government’s scheme for \nseeking to make faster progress than the available funds permitted. If the present \n', '166 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \ncontributors were promised improved benefits it should not be on terms which would \nintroduce inequity between their generation and the next. Under an occupational \nscheme higher benefits meant higher contributions, either to the employees or their \nemployers or, more likely, to both. But under a State scheme the pay-as-you-go principle, \nif strictly applied, meant that the cost of paying higher pensions to existing contributors \nwould be borne after they had retired, and by their children. There were two ways of \ndealing with that problem. One was to leave some element of discretion in the scheme \nwhich would enable future governments to hold back pensions to some extent should \nthey feel that the resources of contributors were insufficient. In normal times earnings \nrose significantly faster than prices. By tying benefits to the cost of living (measured by \na price index) rather than to the standard of living (measured by an earnings index), while \ncontributions were allowed to rise with earnings, a margin of surplus could be obtained \nwhich could be allocated at the discretion of the government of the day according to the \nneeds of the time and having regard to the inequity between generations of pensioners. \nThe Bill, however, specified the use of an index of earnings before retirement. It would \nbe wiser to limit the commitment to an index of prices, for a higher commitment would \ninevitably have to be matched, willy-nilly, for all beneficiaries and would restrict the \nscope for reducing inequity. Sweden, Norway and Belgium had all adopted that ap- \nproach, while West Germany and Austria had tied themselves to an earnings index. \nCanada had acknowledged the particular advantage which accrued to new pensioners as \na result of the accelerated maturity of the Canada Pension Plan, and earnings would \nonly be revalued by a price index during the maturity period, although it was intended \nto go over to an earnings index subsequently. \nThe second way of tackling the problem of equity between generations of contributors \nwas to fund in advance at least a substantial part of the extra benefits the existing con- \ntributors were being promised. That meant charging higher contributions than were \nrequired to meet the pay-as-you-go cost. The excess could be invested, either directly in \nthe stock market or indirectly through occupational schemes. The former process \nwould threaten a kind of back-door nationalization of industry, since the sums involved \nwould be very large. The latter implied partnership with occupational schemes through \npartial contracting-out. \nThe Government had chosen partnership, but by forecasting the growth of the \npay-as-you-go cost on the assumption that all benefits would be tied in practice to the \nearnings index—Table 4 of the Government Actuary’s report—it had failed to give active \nencouragement to contracting-out for fear of forcing up the contribution rates to an \ninflationary level. \nContracting-out was a delicate subject for a life office actuary opening an Institute \ndiscussion because he obviously had a measure of self-interest in it. As a profession they \nshould no doubt ask themselves whether, by rejecting any basis which could not be \nrelated to the market in guaranteed, non-profit deferred annuities, the life offices were \ninterpreting too literally the reference to ‘commercial terms’ in § 139 of the White Paper \nof January 1969. Alternatively, by declining to acknowledge the life offices’ case, had \nthe Government gone back on its word? There ought obviously to be an element of \ncompromise in any bargain between Government and industry, but it could not be Tom \nBrown’s. As would be recalled, one of Tom Brown’s school friends had said of him that \n‘he never wants anything but what’s right and fair; only when you come to settle what’s \nright and fair, it’s everything that he wants, and nothing that you want. And that’s his \nidea of a compromise.’ Was there a Tom Brown in the existing situation? The opinions \nof members would probably differ on the point. \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 167 \nGenerous terms for contracting-out would, of course, only benefit the life offices and \nother pensions interests indirectly: the employer, and perhaps his employees, would be \nthe immediate beneficiary. The argument against generous terms was that the subsidy \ninherent in them created inequity between contracted-in and contracted-out employees \nand their employers. On the other hand, they could be advocated on the grounds that \nmany occupational schemes set up during the past 9 years had as their raison d’être the \nadvantages to be gained from contracting-out, and on such a base better pensions had \nsince been built. Unless repeated extensions of the State scheme in future years were to \nbe envisaged, a further rapid development of occupational schemes should take place. \nThe reason for a new earnings-related State scheme was surely that pensionable em- \nployment, like television, was no longer to be regarded as a luxury but had become a \nnecessity. That was a measure of the major, but by no means total, success of occupational \npensioning since the war. And, of course, pensioning was by far the largest component of \nnet personal savings. \nThe opener then pointed out that in the absence of contracting-out it was obvious \nthat an expansion of State pensions should result in a contraction of occupational \npensions. In a saturated market that effect would be permanent if measured in real \nrather than monetary terms. But the market was not saturated. There was a great deal of \nscope for occupational schemes to be extended and improved, given sufficient stimulus. \nThe form of the new State scheme should of itself stimulate the trend towards inflation- \nproofed benefits, whether through final salary schemes or through schemes which aimed \nto complement the State scheme. The pensioning of the lowest slice of earnings at 60%,, \nthe next slice at 25%, and the remainder not at all should provoke the trade unions to \nseek earnings-related rather than flat-rate occupational pensions. The active interest of \nthe trade unions might well be reflected in more industry-wide schemes for manual \nworkers. The provision of a specific invalidity pension should encourage the develop- \nment of similar benefits under occupational schemes. The high level of pension payable \nto a pensioner’s widow would surely be copied if only the Inland Revenue would permit \nit. \nAll those developments would take time, but in his view they would take place faster if \na good foundation were laid through an attractive and secure basis for partial contract- \ning-out. By a secure basis he meant a sound philosophy, and a sound philosophy ought \nsurely to be related to an agreed definition of commercial terms. He personally would be \nhappier if the Bill were strengthened so that any worsening of the terms had to be justi- \nfied by the Government Actuary in relation to that basic criterion. \nOccupational schemes would never fulfil their proper role in the pensioning of \nemployment so long as an employee’s accrued pension rights, if they were significant, \ncould be lost on a change of job. There the Bill was too timid. The Secretary of State had \nportrayed himself as having had to give way to two pressure groups—the Confederation \nof British Industry who were said to have objected to any compulsory preservation of \nrights which had already accrued, even if spread over a 20-year maturity period, and the \nTrade Union Congress who would not be prepared to accept the withdrawal of an \nemployee’s right to a refund of his own contributions. They must have developed \npsychological warfare to a degree unknown even to Richard Crossman. The outcome \nwould surely be that most members withdrawing from contributory schemes would \nstill take their contributions back, and that the Inland Revenue would continue to \nrefuse in those circumstances to allow any preservation by the employer, apart from the \nequivalent of any pension abatements. The employer with a non-contributory scheme \nwould, however, always have to preserve rights accruing after the Bill became law. \n', '168 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nThus there would be inequity between employers, leading to the risk that non-contribu- \ntory schemes would be altered to permit the employees, by contributing, to destroy \ntheir own pension rights. \nIn a recent article in the Guardian (Saturday, 17 January) Richard Sleight had queried \nthe basic role of the Inland Revenue in formulating limits to occupational pensions \nwhich were approvable for tax purposes. The opener said that on that point he agreed \nwith Richard Sleight whole-heartedly. Occupational schemes were primarily designed to \nmeet a social need. How could that be adequately assessed by a department which \ncould still, after nearly 800 years, be described as ‘a sort of inner sanctuary of sacred \nmysteries which are to be revealed when the books of all are opened and the gates shut’? \nIf the Inland Revenue were to bring forward a new code for the approval of retirement \nand death benefits he hoped the philosophy behind it would be searchingly examined \nboth inside and outside Parliament before it reached the statute book. \nOne last point worried him considerably, and not only because of the further un- \ncertainty which it introduced to upset an already tight timetable. The Opposition, in the \ncourse of the debate on the second reading of the Bill, had promised to repeal that part \nof it which related to retirement pensions. In its place they would put a price-indexed, \nflat-rate pension, paid for by graduated contributions, and on top of that a graduated \nscheme—a more modem version of Boyd Carpenter. It would be designed as a fall-back \narrangement for those who were not completely contracted out of it by virtue of their \nmembership of an occupational scheme. He felt that he ought to sound a note of warning \nthere to his professional colleagues who were tempted by that alternative. Whatever \ncriticism might be levelled at the abatement system, it had been designed by its chief \narchitect, Mr Redington, to be viable with any type of earnings-related State scheme. \nNot only could the terms for abatement reasonably reflect the guaranteed terms avail- \nable in the market, but also if future adjustments were made to accrued State pensions \nthe past abatements need not be disturbed. Neither of those attributes applied to a sys- \ntem of complete contracting-out, for there were no guaranteed terms available for com- \nparison with an index-linked State pension, and a pension which was not index-linked \nwas liable to be altered retrospectively, as one knew from experience. In any case, were \nthey sufficiently confident in the strength of the existing structure of occupational \nschemes to prefer the broad brush of contracting-out? He thought he would rather pick \nup Mr Crossman’s gauntlet, and accept his challenge to improve their schemes in con- \njunction with the stricter discipline of abatement. \nIn conclusion, the opener said that he had tried to chart some of the waters which \nothers might wish to sail during the discussion. But, with his 12th century companion, ‘I \nfear that the shades of approaching night may put a stop to the business under discus- \nsion, and that, many cardinal points having been omitted, thou wilt hasten to rid \nthyself of an importunate questioner.’ Lest that happen, he ought to give others better \nqualified than himself time to make these cardinal points. \nMr H. A. R. Barnett pointed out that the Government’s proposals had been criticized \nelsewhere because of their complexity. He did not suggest that they were complex to \nanyone present, but had the Government tried to introduce what he called a ‘Lyon- \nhearted’ scheme, it would have been criticized for being still more complex. He thought \nthey should accept that with all the equities that the opener had mentioned as being \ndesirable they could not expect more than rough equity. \nWhen the previous year’s discussion had taken place on the first White Paper he had \nexpressed the view that the proposals were, for a number of different reasons, inflationary. \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 169 \nNothing that had happened since then had shaken that view. The proposals would im- \npose a heavy burden on the national economy, particularly at those times in the future \nwhen the contribution rates would have to rise above the initial percentages. \nIt was generally accepted that a State scheme of superannuation had to be on a pay-as- \nyou-go basis. He had no quarrel with that, but unfortunately the higher the ‘go’ the \nhigher the ‘pay’, i.e. indirectly the higher the cost of the national product. His objection \nto the proposals was that the benefits at the higher end of the earnings scale were \nunnecessary. \nUp to the first half of national average earnings he would go further than the pro- \nposals in the Bill by having immediately a minimum State retirement pension for a \nsingle person equal to 60% of half the national average. He considered that in a State \nscheme weighting in favour of the lower stratum of earnings was essential. However, \nbeyond that he would like to see the 25% reduced to something of the order of 10% and \napplying only to the second half of national average earnings, so that the pension- \nability of anything above the national average—say £1,300 a year at current levels— \nwould be left entirely to occupational schemes. Subject to the fact that a minimum pen- \nsion would require a minimum contribution, which could be compared to the flat-rate \ncontribution which operated at the present time, he calculated that the scheme so \nmodified could be financed by contribution rates similar to those proposed in the Bill, \nbut without the need for future increases as the maturity period passed, as the 60% \nminimum which he had suggested would have immediate maturity. Indeed the 10% on \nthe second half of national earnings could also have immediate maturity were it not for \nthe administrative difficulty that it is very difficult to go back and consider what earnings \nhad been in the past when they had not been recorded. \nThe effects of the modifications he had suggested would be: (1) that where benefits \nwere being increased they would be granted to a necessary extent only; (2) that sup- \nplementary retirement benefits from the State would become unnecessary as all persons \nover the State retiring age—including the present non-pensioners—would receive at \nleast the minimum pension, at current levels about £7 5s. a week, plus the present mar- \nried person’s addition where applicable; (3) it would be possible to place the same \nceiling on the employer’s as on the employee’s contributions; and (4) at the levels he had \nproposed the complications of partial contracting-out could, if desired, be dispensed with \naltogether or, alternatively, partial contracting-out on the abatement principle would \nstill be feasible. \nOn the subject of contracting-out, he said that the opener had mentioned Mr Reding- \nton as having been the architect of the abatement principle. He was reminded of things \nthat were said about the army which was always fighting last time’s war. The abatement \nprinciple would have been eminently desirable had it been accepted 10 or 11 years \nearlier. He was not so certain, in connexion with the current proposals, whether it was as \nattractive as it had seemed when Mr Redington had first suggested it. \nHe apologized for having appeared to take a political line in his remarks, but it was \nalmost impossible either to agree with or to criticize the Bill without leaning to the view \nof one or other of the political parties. It was a great pity that State pensions could not \nhave been taken out of party politics and reviewed by an all-party or a non-party com- \nmittee, as was done in the days of Beveridge. He did not believe the three parties were \nso very far apart in their views as to render it impossible to devise a system acceptable to \nall three had they so wished. He believed that that could have been achieved if some non- \nparty body, such as the Institute of Actuaries, with no particular affiliation in any direc- \ntion, could have offered its advice. \n', '170 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nUnfortunately, any such pronouncements by the Institute on the matter would have \nbeen outside its Objects, which were stated in its Charter and Byelaws and which had \nremained unaltered for 121 years. As any discussion on the matter at an Ordinary \nMeeting would have contravened Byelaw 68, he gave notice of raising the matter at the \nAnnual General Meeting in June, when he hoped that they might be able to see that \nparticular piece of antique Victoriana for what it was. \nFinally, he expressed his agreement with all the opener had said on the question of \npreservation and refunds. \nMr F. W. Bacon wished to make two brief comments on particular aspects of the National \nSuperannuation and Social Insurance Bill and then to go on to the wider question of the \nBill as a whole. \nThe first point was the question of the terms of abatement. He did not find himself in \nagreement with a lot of the criticisms that had been made of those terms. If it could be \nassumed that conditions would remain as they were then, his own personal view was \nthat the terms were not at all bad, but the difficulty, of course, lay in that proviso. It was \nonly about 15 months previously that War Loan had been on a 7½% yield basis. It had \ngone up from there in the space of about 12 months to nearly 9½%, and was currently \nback at just under 9%. Given swings of that sort, he thought it was a brave man who was \ngoing to say what the yield on Government securities was going to be in two years’ time, \nlet alone five years’ time when, apparently, the first review might perhaps be made. There- \nfore, whereas he felt the terms were not unreasonable then, he would find it very difficult \nto advise any employer to accept them for a period ranging from two to five years \nthence. He thought there would be a lot to be said for having an automatic provision \nfor revision of those terms on a sort of sliding scale basis, making an adjustment for \neach 1% change, say, in the rate of interest. Something of the sort would reassure many \nadvisers on occupational schemes who would have the responsibility for advising \nemployers on the question of whether or not they should contract out. \nHis second point was concerned with the question of accelerated maturity. That, he \nfelt, was going to give rise to a lot of difficulty in modifying occupational schemes to \ntake account of the State scheme. It was relatively easy to modify schemes to allow for \nthe National Superannuation benefits except for that particular feature, because if an \nemployer had an adequate scheme of benefits, taking account of both his own and the \nnormal State benefits, it might be that an existing employee aged 45, who was going to \nbenefit from the accelerated maturity, would have extremely generous total benefits \nwhen he retired and might even finish up with a pension in excess of the income he was \nearning before retirement. \nTurning to the wider issues, he said that he had a nasty feeling that he was going to \nfind himself at variance with Mr Lyon, Mr Crossman, Lord Balniel, and probably \neverybody else; in other words, he would be in his usual position, out on a limb in a \nminority of one. However, to his mind many of the complications and difficulties in the \nNational Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill arose because it was really trying to \ngraft on to a pay-as-you-go scheme concepts which were appropriate to properly \nfunded schemes. As Mr Lyon had explained, State pay-as-you-go really meant taxing \ncurrent earnings to provide current pensions. That was appropriate when the proportion \nof pensioners to active population would remain fairly constant and also when the level \nof benefits would remain fairly constant, but if either rose significantly in the future, \nthen the level of tax, even if it were called ‘contribution’, would rise also, and future \ngenerations would have to pay more for the current generation’s pensions than the cur- \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 171 \nrent generation was prepared to pay to existing pensioners. In the case of a funded \nscheme the opposite principle obtained. There proper contributions were paid into the \nfund from the beginning by the present earners to provide their pensions so that they \nwould not be a burden on future generations. That was particularly appropriate in the \ncase of earnings-related benefits. The real trouble arose when people tried to mix up the \ntwo ideas, and he did not think they would really clear up the confusion until they \nseparated them. That meant first of all recognizing that pay-as-you-go was taxation and \nnot contributions, and that, therefore, it should carry no rights to future pensions. \nSecondly, it meant that any increase in future pension rights which was not being given \nto existing pensioners should be financed by a proper actuarial contribution in addition \nto the taxation required for existing pensions. His own view (which was where, he \nthought, he would probably find himself in a minority of one) would be that the pay-as- \nyou-go pension should be restricted to a minimum, for example to the current level, \nperhaps uplifted to allow for increases in the cost of living. Admittedly that would mean \nretaining supplementary benefits, although he hoped on a more generous basis than the \nexisting one, and particularly more generous in relation to the conditions under which \nthey were granted. Possibly some form of negative income tax might be used. But all that \nwas a matter for discussion. Whatever level was fixed, he suggested that it should apply \nto existing pensioners and should be financed by taxation, not by contributions. If that \nwere done then the way would be clear for a new scheme to provide for pensions in \nrespect of future service-with earnings-related benefits based on proper actuarial \ncontributions. That could be done either through occupational schemes with a State \nfall-back scheme, as had been done, for example, with sickness before the war when there \nhad been a State-operated friendly society for those who could not or would not join \nany of the existing friendly societies-he did not share the opener’s fears about that \nparticular development. Alternatively, there could be a universal State scheme, but \nwith 100% contracting-out for occupational schemes, and, because the contributions \nwould not be used in effect to finance existing pay-as-you-go pensions, that could be \ndone without harming the State scheme at all. As something like 80% of the eligible \nemployed males were, in fact, already in occupational schemes, it could well be that \nwhichever of those two forms were adopted they would come to roughly the same thing \nbecause the State element would, in fact, be comparatively small. His own view was that \nthere might be some advantage in having the universal scheme rather than the fall-back, \neven if in practice they did come to roughly the same thing, as it might be easier to deal \nwith the question of preservation of pension rights on change of employment. Again, \nthat was a matter for discussion. The important point was the principle of dis- \ntinguishing between taxation and contributions, using the former to pay for the existing \nflat-rate pension, and the latter for building up any increased future pensions which were \nfelt to be desirable. Unfortunately, as far as he could make out, both the Government \nand the Opposition were going the opposite way. They seemed to be wanting to replace \nthe existing supplementary pensions by pay-as-you-go pensions which, in effect, meant \nreplacing benefits paid for out of taxation by benefits paid for by contributions which \ncarried rights to future pensions. That seemed to him to be the opposite of what was \nreally required. \nMr R. J. W. Crabbe said that Mr Lyon had started many hares which he would dearly \nlove to pursue, but time was short so he ought to confine himself to one aspect which had \nproved the most controversial, namely, the terms of contracting-out. One of the difficul- \nties of that problem was that it was only partly actuarial. That had been recognized \n', '172 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nin the original White Paper which had specified that the terms should be related to the \n‘commercial cost of providing the pension which was being taken over by the occupa- \ntional scheme’. It was important at that stage to be clear as to what was meant by ‘com- \nmercial cost’. He suggested that it should be the price which would be agreed between \ntwo free contracting parties operating in a competitive market, and that in a continuing \nseries of transactions there should be a clearly understood procedure for adjusting the \nprice in line with changes in market conditions. The difficulties of applying such a \ndefinition to the present case were obvious, but they had recently had an example which \nunderlined the dangers of not doing so, namely the escalation of the Boyd Carpenter \npensions which had a retrospective effect. \nThe first step towards settling the commercial cost was to assess the range of possible \nvariations in the eventual cost to employers of carrying out their part of the bargain. \nThe terms currently fixed would not come into operation until 1972, and were then \nlikely to remain unchanged for at least three years. Moreover, the ultimate outcome \nwould not be known for 30 or 40 years, and would depend on a number of elements of \nexperience which could be expected to vary widely. It was quite impossible to forecast \nthe variations. \nIn order to illustrate the difficulties he asked members to consider the assumptions \nunderlying the contribution abatement of 1·25% a side, which had been increased by the \nGovernment to 1·3% to make some allowance for dispersion of schemes about the mean. \nAs Mr Bacon had pointed out, the assumption as to the rate of interest was extremely \ndifficult to make in the light of the recent history of the long-term rate of interest. He \nbelieved that as recently as April 1967 it had been as low as 6½%. Bearing in mind the \ncurrent speed of economic and political change, who could say what was the right rate \nfor such a forward contract? It could be the 7½/5½% used in the Government Actuary’s \ncalculations, but it could be a number of other rates. \nHowever, that was not the whole story. Mortality rates also presented exceptional \ndifficulty since the mortality experienced between ages 60 and 75 by men retiring some \n20 years after the inception of the scheme would be of particular importance in deter- \nmining the ultimate cost. It was there that he had found himself troubled by the assump- \ntions made in the White Paper. Up to about age 50 the rates of improvement assumed \ndid not differ widely between the sexes. Thus at age 45 the improvement assumed in 20 \nyears was about 24% for males and 27% for females, but at age 65 the corresponding \nimprovements were 8% for males and 17% for females, whilst at age 75 only 4% was \nassumed for males compared with 11% for females. On general grounds he found the \nphilosophy of that distinction difficult to follow, since he would have thought that with \nadvances in medical science the scope for improvement in male mortality was at least as \ngreat as that for improvement in female mortality. He recognized that those results had \nbeen achieved by projecting into the future what had actually happened in the last 20 \nyears or so, when male mortality at the higher ages had failed to match the improvement \nshown by female mortality. He suggested, however, that that past difference was, at the \nleast, an uncertain guide to the future. \nDuring the 1960s the age group 65 to 75 had consisted overwhelmingly of the genera- \ntion that had gone through the trenches in the First World War. Whilst they could only \nguess, surely it was reasonable to take account of the possibility that that experience had \nhad some effect on their constitutions. If so, it followed that they might expect male \nmortality at those ages not only to improve as rapidly as female mortality but, possibly, \nmore rapidly, because the base line from which they were operating had been artificially \nraised. \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 173 \nSimilar problems arose in assessing expenses, especially in relation to the effect of \ninflation on the proper charge to be made in money contracts for the cost of paying \npensions far in the future. That problem was one which had not been mentioned in the \nWhite Paper. \nHe hoped he had said sufficient to illustrate his point that a calculation of that type \nwas in no sense a unique forecast, but was merely one among a range of possible illustra- \ntions of the effects of different sets of assumptions. What, then, was the function of the \nactuary? It seemed to him that the actuary’s strength lay in the fact that he had at his \ndisposal techniques which enabled him to devise, for the assistance of his clients, \nacceptable financial programmes which would enable them to provide for that type of \nuncertain liability. Thus it was perfectly valid to select one such calculation as a pro- \nvisional estimate subject to periodical correction on which to base the funding of a pen- \nsion scheme when it operated by self-investment or through with-profit insurance \npolicies-a technique described by Mr Redington as ‘homing on a moving target’. He \ndid not, however, believe that it was justifiable to select any one such calculation as the \nbasis of a contract on fixed-cost terms. He accepted the reasons which had led the \nGovernment Actuary to make the calculation he had described as ‘a special calculation \ntaking into account the basic factors of interest and mortality and expenses’, but was the \nGovernment justified in describing that, or any other equally arguable calculation, as a \nrecommendation ‘on strict actuarial grounds’, or in assuming that any departure from \nit would necessarily involve unfairness to those not contracted-out? \nIt was at that point, it seemed to him, that the problem moved out of the sphere of \nactuarial assessment into that of a commercial bargain. In other words, granted that \nthere was a probability distribution of possible outcomes, some of them more favourable \nto the employer than the Government terms, some more expensive to the employer, \nwhat sort of bargain would be likely to be reached if there were a free market such as \nhe had postulated when he had begun to speak? There was, of course, no such free \nmarket in that particular case, so it seemed to him that the practical course was to seek \nan analogous situation where such a market had already operated. That was, he sub- \nmitted, immediately available in the non-profit contracts issued by life assurance com- \npanies. It was, of course, necessary to allow for the effect of the narrowness of the non- \nprofit market which was referred to in the Government Actuary’s memorandum, but \nin that connexion a useful guide was the margin over with-profit costs which was re- \nquired by insurers and which was acceptable to those clients who wished for a fixed-price \ncontract. That margin seemed to be about 15%. Seeing that the terms offered by the \nGovernment in the White Paper were very close to the current with-profit costs, he \nsuggested that the terms offered for abatement should reasonably be set some 15% \nhigher, so producing a figure in the neighbourhood of 1½% a side instead of the 1·3% a \nside which appeared in the White Paper. \nMr K. G. Smith noted that the National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nfollowed closely the lines of the proposals published a year previously. The formalities \nof consultation had been gone through. The expected emergence of conflicting views \nhad enabled the Secretary of State to ignore informed opinion and cast doubt on its \nintegrity. On the one point on which such opinion had been virtually unanimous (the \nunattractive terms for partial abatement) the Secretary of State had made a concession \nso small as to be virtually meaningless, \nThe basis of the proposed new arrangements was so different from the basis of current \nNational Insurance arrangements that it was not easy to relate the two. He thought, \n', '174 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nhowever, that it was worth trying to identify the main distinctions. The current arrange- \nments fell into two sections. First, there were the flat-rate benefits related to flat-rate \ncontributions. The single person’s retirement pension (to which most of the other \nbenefits were related) was currently £5 per week. That scheme was revised upwards from \ntime to time, usually in line with the rise in the cost of living and sometimes by rather \nmore, on a timing which appeared to have some relationship to general elections. \nSecondly, there were the graduated benefits related to graduated contributions on earn- \nings between £9 and £30 per week. When that section had first been introduced in 1961 \nand related to earnings up to £l5 per week it had been practicable for an employer \nproviding benefits not less favourable to contract out, subject to the imposition of a \npenalty in the form of a small increase in the flat-rate contribution for both employees \nand employer. That option had been preserved when the maximum earnings had been \nraised from £l5 to £l8 per week, but had not been allowed in more recent changes, the \nlast of which had raised the limit to £30 per week. Graduated pensions had not been \nsubject to revision (except for the upper limit for contributions) but the Secretary of \nState had announced in 1969 that he proposed to include such pensions in his two-yearly \nreview under the new scheme-a retrospective change in the previous basis for con- \ntracting-out which had naturally caused a certain amount of scepticism about the \nreliability of assurances on future treatment of pension funds which sought to provide \nsubstituted benefits for National Insurance scheme benefits. \nIf the very small percentage of employees whose earnings throughout life would not \naverage one-half of national average earnings were ignored, the proposed scheme could \nalso be regarded as falling into two sections: (i) a fixed benefit which was determined in \nrelation to national average earnings and under which the single person’s retirement \npension would be 35% of half of national average earnings or, at present levels, say \n£4 4s. per week. Benefits were to be adjusted at two-yearly intervals instead of arbitrarily \nas currently; (ii) graduated benefits determined in relation to earnings up to one and \none-half times national average earnings (under which the single person’s retirement \npension was a further pension of 25% of average earnings up to that limit) and related to \nnational average earnings at retirement. Alternatively, they could take the first half of \nnational average earnings and say that the pension on that was 60% or £7 4s. per week \nfixed, and then 25% on the excess of half national average earnings (currently £12) up \nto one and one-half times national average earnings (about £36 per week). The whole \nof the contributions for both those sections were, however, then to be earnings-related, \nthe fixed element under the existing scheme disappearing. \nLooked at from that angle, the new proposals were seen to be less revolutionary than \nappeared at first, the main changes being: (i) contributions wholly earnings-related \nalthough only part of the benefits was earnings-related (the redistribution element); \n(ii) revision of benefits at regular rather than irregular intervals; (iii) expansion in the \namount of total benefit because of the increased scale and proportion of graduated benefit \nand guaranteed revision. \nOn the whole, he thought the first two of those changes, earnings-related contributions \n(basically a form of direct taxation) and regular benefit revision, were inevitable and \nprobably desirable. He was not so sure that an expansion in the scale of total State \nbenefit was either inevitable or desirable. \nCommenting next on partial contracting-out and preservation of pensions, Mr Smith \nsaid that the pretence that benefits were somehow related to contributions on a kind of \ninsurance basis (implicit in the graduated scheme introduced in 1961 and reinforced \nin the new Bill) made it difficult to allow any large-scale contracting-out because the \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 175 \nreduction in the contributions was likely to be less, pro rata, than the reduction in the \nbenefits. That was because the contributions were determined in relation to current \noutgoings and not on any actuarial assessment of cost of future benefits. As he had men- \ntioned in the previous discussion, it would be quite practicable to allow a much greater \ndegree of pension abatement than the 1% per annum proposed. Indeed, on any reasonable \nassumption about future rates of growth in national average earnings, 1·8% could be \nadopted and still leave a margin of pension benefit payable by the State. That might, \nhowever, reduce the immediate future contribution income by more than the Secretary \nof State would be prepared to countenance notwithstanding the fact that more distant \nfuture liabilities would be reduced on a basis which, by definition, would be equivalent. \nIt was not, therefore, surprising to find that reasons were found to reject it. \nAs to the terms of partial abatement, he thought it should be borne in mind that \npension schemes did not have the same scope for retrospective adjustment as was open \nto governments and would not be able to recoup any shortfall in cost of provision of \nequivalent pension benefits by a levy on future contributors. The basis of the terms for \npartial abatement had been disclosed. It seemed to him doubtful whether many em- \nployers would be advised to fund new pension arrangements on such a basis. \nHe had always regarded the loss of accrued pension benefits on transfer between em- \nployments as a major defect of existing pension provisions, and he welcomed the \nbelated attempt to improve the position. The real trouble was that the attraction of a \ncash alternative was irresistible to many employees who might subsequently regret it. He \nsupposed it would be too much to expect anyone to run the risk of being branded as the \nman who prevented employees getting their money back, but perhaps a more realistic \nrate of tax on refunded contributions—e.g. if they were treated as income in the year of \nreceipt-would discourage the lapse of built-up benefits. Since the Secretary of State \nhad not shrunk from retrospective changes in other directions, it seemed a pity that that \nshould be the one area where, because some employers had voiced opposition to retro- \nspection, he had chosen not to impose it. \nHe would also like to see considerable development outside the public sector of the \narrangements which existed within it for ‘flow-through’ of pension benefits in a way which \nenabled past service with a former employer to count in full for benefit with the new \nemployer. He appreciated the actuarial and other problems which that imposed, but \ninterchange procedure within the public sector had shown that those problems could be \nsolved, given collective goodwill. Legislation might not be the right answer, but some \nkind of stimulus, e.g. through favourable taxation treatment, might help. It was a field \nactuaries should be prepared to explore and develop. \nIn conclusion he said that he did not welcome the National Superannuation and \nSocial Insurance Bill. He considered the improvements it introduced were more than \noffset by the damage it would inflict on existing pensions schemes, the shortcomings of \nwhich it did little to rectify. It would do more harm than good. \nMr G. V. Bayley wished to raise two points, the first of which related to the terms for \nabatement. He was very glad that Mr Lyon and Mr Crabbe had drawn attention to the \nimportance to be attached to the interpretation of commercial cost. It seemed to him \ncapable of two clear practical meanings, and perhaps only two. One was what the cost \nwould turn out to be when the experience was ultimately known. Obviously that inter- \npretation could not help them in 1972. The other was the price which willing buyer and \nwilling seller would strike in a competitive market, each party taking whatever expert \nadvice could be obtained. That was the criterion, as he understood it, which Mr Crabbe \n', '176 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nhad advocated-very convincingly, he thought. It seemed to him that by rejecting it the \nGovernment had discarded the one firm and objective measure of what should be in- \ncluded for the cost of the guarantee which the contracted-out employer had to undertake. \nEven if 1·5% a side turned out to be a favourable price for the guaranteed commitment, \nwho, other than the market at the time of the contract, was to say that it was more than \nthe guarantee was worth when it was, in fact, undertaken? \nHis second point was directed to the Government’s concern to limit the extent of con- \ntracting-out in order to preserve sufficient revenue for the State Superannuation fund. \nIndeed, that requirement had virtually been advanced in some quarters as a justifiable \npurpose in itself in fixing the terms for abatement. He believed the implications there were \nserious. If contracting-out were sufficient to cause the rates of contribution to be raised, \nor raised earlier than they otherwise would have been, then the proportionate burden on \ndifferent generations would be made less unfair than it looked like being at the moment. \nThe scheme was promising additional benefits (compared with the existing ones) at a \nfuture date which, on any commercial approach, would cost a great deal more in contri- \nbutions than the Government was asking initial contributors to pay. It was wrong, \ntherefore, to suggest that it would be in any sense unfair if contributions were pushed \nhigher earlier than proposed. If the current generation felt it could not afford that, then \nthe prospective benefits which they were promising themselves should be less extrava- \ngant. They should wait upon the emergence and allocation of the necessary resources \naccording to the priorities of the time. It was the attempt to have it both ways that would, \nin his opinion, justify the reproach of their successors and give them the excuse to repudi- \nate the commitment when the time came to meet it, or at any rate to modify it. \nMr F. R. Langham said that in the 12 months since the first White Paper on the new \nState scheme had been issued the discussion about the scheme had crystallized around \ntwo distinct points of view. There were those who accepted the idea of an earnings- \nrelated State scheme in principle and had not questioned the fundamental basis or \nstructure. Apart from Mr Crossman and Mr Ennals, the main public protagonists of that \npoint of view had been the spokesmen for the Life Offices’ Associations. Adversity, or \nwas it abatement, made strange bedfellows! On the other hand, there were those who \nquestioned whether an earnings-related State scheme was necessary or desirable, and \npreferred a flat-rate benefit scheme at a higher level than the existing one, financed either \nout of general taxation or by earnings-related contributions. More recently, some sup- \nporters of that point of view had also proposed that there should be a State supplemen- \ntary scheme to cover employees who were not members of occupational schemes. The \nsupporters of that proposal included the National Association of Pension Funds, the \nLiberal Party, Sir Paul Chambers, and last but by no means least, it now seemed that the \nConservative Party had joined the ranks, but for the moment they were just cheering \nfrom the terraces. \nHe was very much in favour of the flat-rate alternative but, unfortunately, it was \nnecessary to face the uncomfortable fact that it was not the flat-rate scheme that was \ngoing to be considered by Parliament but the Government’s earnings-related scheme. \nIn numerous speeches up and down the country, Mr Crossman and Mr Ennals had \nattacked occupational schemes and, at the same time, defended their own scheme by \nclaiming that there were certain things a State scheme could do that an occupational \nscheme could not. By and large those points had been answered, but he would like to \nmention six ways in which an occupational scheme was superior to the proposed State \nscheme. \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 177 \nFirst, no occupational scheme would be introduced whereby when it reached full \nmaturity virtually no members would be able to obtain the maximum benefits according \nto the rules. But that was precisely the position under the Government scheme. In order \nto obtain maximum benefits a new entrant at age 19 would need to be already earning at \nleast one and one-half times the national average earnings and would have to continue \nto earn above that figure for the rest of his working lifetime. In addition, he ought not \nto be. sick or unemployed for more than three consecutive days. There were a number of \nways of overcoming that difficulty, and he suggested that one of the following two \nmethods could be adopted. There was the system that was used in the United States \nwhereby the worst 5 years’ earnings were not included in the averaging. Alternatively, \nthere was the system that had been suggested by the National Association of Pension \nFunds under which only the best 20 years’ earnings counted. \nHis second objection was that the proposed State scheme was unnecessarily complica- \nted. Some occupational schemes were a little complicated, but for very good reasons, \nbut he could not imagine that there would be many, if any, occupational schemes with a \nmixture of earnings-related and money purchase benefits. He was referring in particular \nto the pension of 6% of contributions paid between the 6 April prior to the 65th birth- \nday and retirement. That really was an unnecessary complication. Surely it would not \nbe too difficult to base the average on earnings up to the 5 April prior to, say, the 63rd \nbirthday, but continue to collect contributions up to the 65th birthday without granting \ntiny little bits of extra pension. \nHis third point concerned the method of calculating widows’ pensions. No occupa- \ntional schemes would penalize the younger widow vis-à-vis the older widow. But that \nwas precisely what the State scheme did, since in determining the widow’s pension pro- \njected earnings were used, but it was assumed that the employee would only have earned \nhalf the national average from his date of death until retirement age. Therefore, the longer \nthe interval between the date of death and retirement age, the lower the widow’s pension \nwas likely to be in relation to earnings. Surely the State scheme could adopt the method \nused by most occupational schemes and base the widow’s pension on the employee’s \nactual or average earnings up to the date of death. \nA fourth advantage of occupational schemes was that they were far more flexible \nthan the proposed State scheme. They gave flexibility to employers in that it was possible \nto choose an appropriate retirement age for the industry or occupation concerned, and \nthey also gave employees a wide choice such as early or late retirement options, partial \ncommutation, etc. One of the basic faults of a State pension scheme was that it could not \nbe flexible, and that was one reason why it was so desirable to have a minimum State \npension and a maximum occupational pension. \nHis fifth point was in connexion with the method of collecting contributions. In a \ncontributory occupational scheme, employees’ contributions were normally collected \nevenly over the year, but in the new State scheme it was proposed that contributions \nshould be collected on full pay until the employee had paid the maximum due for the \nyear in question, and thereafter giving him a contribution holiday until the beginning of \nthe next tax year. That penalized the higher paid in a scheme that already penalized \nthem by the redistributive nature of the pension formula. \nFinally, there was the problem of tax relief on employees’ contributions. That was \nallowed if they were paid to an occupational scheme, but at present contributions to the \nState scheme were not allowable. In point of fact, contributions to a State scheme were a \ntax by another name so that giving tax relief on them would only have the effect of \nrequiring other taxes to be increased. Nevertheless, it might be desirable to allow the \n', '178 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nfirst 1·3% of contributions to the State scheme as a deduction for tax purposes so as to \nbe consistent with the tax treatment for employees who were lucky enough to be con- \ntracted out. \nThat led Mr Langham quite naturally to consider contracting-out. Because of the \ncontracting-out feature, the Government scheme was even more complicated, but he \nwas afraid that was inevitable. With a flat-rate benefit scheme, contracting-out would \nnot be necessary and, indeed, probably not possible, but given that they were to have an \nearnings-related benefit scheme, then the form of contracting-out proposed was to be \nwelcomed since it would assist occupational schemes in adjusting for the enlarged scope \nof the State scheme and it might also mitigate against the fall in total savings that a num- \nber of prophets of doom had prophesied would occur if there were no contracting-out. \nHe was a little sceptical about the risk of a substantial fall in savings since if a company’s \ntotal pension costs were reduced as a result of switching a greater proportion of the \nbenefits to a pay-as-you-go basis, then a high proportion of the additional profits gener- \nated by that reduction would probably be retained and it would only be the proportion \npaid out in dividends and not reinvested that would have the effect of reducing savings. \nThe contracting-out option was one that had been included in the scheme to help \noccupational schemes, and he felt that some of the statements that had been made \ncriticizing the method and the basis adopted by the Government Actuary were com- \npletely unjustified. In his view the basis on which the terms had been arrived at was not \nunrealistic. He failed to follow the market place arguments put forward in some quarters. \nThe market place did not consist of only non-profit policies. In fact, the major part of \nthe market was occupied by self-invested funds and with-profits insurance contracts, \nand he suggested that for those products the terms were fair assuming an average age \ndistribution amongst the consumers. Even the non-profits argument did not really hold \nwater. If insurance companies were today advertising single premium non-profit con- \ntracts yielding about 8% per annum after expenses, he failed to see why the basis used \nby the Government Actuary of 7½% per annum interest on the initial investment plus \n5½% per annum on reinvestment, plus an expenses loading of 7%, was considered to be \nso unrealistic. The critics of those terms were, in his view, doing a great disservice to the \noccupational pension scheme movement. If the relationship was on the basis suggested \nby them, which was of the order of a 1·5% contribution for a 1% pension, instead of the \n1·3% proposed by the Government and the 1·25% as calculated by the Government \nActuary, then it could in the very short term bring the whole of the contracting-out \nfeature into disrepute. If the 1·5% terms were adopted, then substantial surpluses would \nbe made by some funds, the State scheme would go into the red very shortly after it \nstarted, and the next thing that would happen would be the removal of the contracting- \nout option altogether. Even more disingenuous was the suggestion that the escalation on \naverage earnings should be price-indexed and not earnings-indexed as that would then \ngive a greater amount of surplus in each year which could then be used to improve the \ncontracting-out terms. Was it really seriously suggested that there should be an even \nmore complicated State scheme with lower benefits so that contracting-out could be \nmore profitable? \nMr G. W. Pingstone pointed out that Mr Langham seemed to be referring to terms \napplicable at the present time when the scheme at the earliest was not going to go into \noperation for at least 2 years. Not a single speaker seemed to have doubted that 1972 \nwas practical. He thought it wholly unrealistic to imagine that the scheme could go into \nforce before 1973. The situation was that at the very best the Bill would not get through \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 179 \nthe House for some months, and a great deal of it also depended on regulations, which \npresumably would not see the light of day until after the Bill had been passed. That \nwould take up some more months. Simultaneously there was the situation in which it \nwas known that the Inland Revenue was giving a great deal of thought to the taxation \ntreatment of superannuation arrangements but had not yet publicized what it had in \nmind, and presumably what it did have in mind would have to go into a tax bill, and that \ntax bill would not become law before the beginning of August 1970. So there again there \nwas a time delay. He stated quite categorically, as one with long experience of occupation- \nal pensions (including the implementation of the 1961 Graduated State Scheme) that it \nwas just not practical to do everything that needed to be done to advise all the employers \nwith occupational schemes before 1973. \nMr R. E. Hayward wished to place on record his view that the suggestion that future \ngenerations were going to subsidize to too great an extent the pensions of the current \ngeneration was an over-simplification of the situation. Part of the contributions which \nthe current generation of workers was making towards the future was in the cost of \neducation, which was going up-some would say rightly so-by leaps and bounds. That \nwould enable the future generation to make a better living, to increase the national \nproduct, and would also enable them to afford the pensions of the current generation. \nMr D. F. Gilley found it very difficult to know where politics ended and the professional \nside began. He had listened to the opener who had devoted a large part of his speech to \nthe question of taxation and equity. However, he felt there was no equity in taxation. \nThere was, in fact, no equity in a national insurance scheme but there was equity, if one \nlooked hard enough, in some of the occupational schemes. What he found appalling was \nthe problem of integrating an occupational scheme which was funded in advance with \na State scheme which was funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. They had been accustomed \nup to then to allowing in occupational schemes for State benefits by a salary adjustment, \nwhich had the advantage, at any rate, that they could use the same net salary for \nworking out pensions and for working out contributions and, as any man in the street \nknew, that was fair, or he thought it was fair. But with a State pension, which had at least \nfour parameters (and according to Lord Balneil, five), he failed to see how they could very \neasily integrate on the benefits side and, at the same time, have a logical modification on \nthe contributions side. Even if it could be devised for one occupational scheme, it \nwould be very hard to say that the same sort of relationship should apply in another \nscheme where the employee was supporting an entirely different percentage of the cost of \nthe total benefits. \nBe that as it might, the State scheme which had been put forward seemed to him to \nsuffer from at least eight defects. He had arrived at the figure eight because he could \ndevise a different scheme which, whilst it might have defects of its own, certainly did not \nsuffer from at least eight objections to the Crossman plan. \nHe thought that everyone present would agree that ‘pensioneering’ ought to be taken \nout of politics, and the booklet An Appeal to Statesmanship, published in 1959 by the \nCouncils of the Institute and the Faculty, had made that point very forcibly, although \nnot perhaps forcibly enough to impress the politicians. If they could have a State pen- \nsion scheme which reduced the rate of national insurance contribution, that would be \nto the good, and given the will it could be done. One of the difficulties of the Crossman \nscheme was that it did nothing for the current generation of pensioners. If they were to \nsay that every pensioner then living should have a pension equal to 60% of one-half of \nB \n', '180 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nthe national average wage, that would cost the equivalent of 3s. 9d. a week from each \nside, if Mr Ennals had done his arithmetic right (and if he had done his interpolation \nfrom Mr Ennals’s arithmetic correctly).* There would, of course, be a corresponding \nincrease in the married woman’s benefit. If it was said that the existing pensioner should \nhave that, it could not be said that the man who retired the following week should not \nhave it, but it could be said that that man could have that proportion of it which his \nservice from the age of 19 up to date permits. So that, on that basis, the man who was at \npresent 19 on reaching the age of 65 would have a proportion of nil, and the people who \nretired in the intervening 46 years would have a progressively reducing proportion of 60% \nof one-half of the national average wage. He said he would not complicate matters by \nreferring to inflation. However, they could not leave the matter there because that meant \nthat an increasing proportion of people to an increasing extent would have no national \ninsurance pension. \nWhat the Government did not do--although it complained about two worlds-was \nanything to encourage the growth of occupational pension schemes with their advan- \ntages over the National Insurance scheme. But there were schemes which had existed \nfor many years covering industries, and to say that they could not arrange schemes cover- \ning agricultural workers and building labourers, for example, was demonstrably non- \nsense. In the building industry there already existed a scheme for transferring holiday \npay from one employer to another. If they could arrange a matter like that they could \narrange an industry-wide pension scheme which would provide preservation auto- \nmatically. Therefore the Government might require that one-forty-fifth of 60% of half \nthe national average earnings must be provided by the employer’s scheme for every year \nafter the reconstruction of the National Insurance scheme, and might say to the employer \n‘if you do not set up this scheme we will make you do it through us and, because ours is \non a pay-as-you-go basis, there will be no allowance for interest and the contribution will \nbe thoroughly repulsive, so there will be an immediate incentive to contract out’. If the \nemployers’ organizations, the trade unions and the chambers of commerce put their \nminds to it, given the advice of actuaries, they could create industry schemes and that \ncould be done. The consequences would be that they would have a simpler scheme, \ndespite his rather rambling exposition, than Crossman’s proposed scheme, which was \ncompletely incomprehensible to the man on the shop floor-at least it was when he had \ntried to explain it; they would have an immediate increase in pensions in course of pay- \nment, which they would not have from Crossman’s scheme; they would facilitate inte- \ngration; they would facilitate contracting-out, or rather make it 100% contracting-out; \nthey would avoid the immorality of promising themselves more than they were pre- \npared to pay to their parents; they would not impair the saving generated by the private \nschemes; they would not impair the security of a substantial proportion of a man’s \nretirement income; and lastly and most important of all, they would take a very large \npart of pension provision out of the hands of the politicians and put it in the hands of \ntrustees. \nMr C. G. Lewin drew attention to one actuarial matter which had not received real con- \nsideration during the discussion, which was the importance of the age distribution. \nQuite rightly that had been emphasized by the Government Actuary in his report but it \nwas important to realize that schemes with an above-average age distribution were \n* Mr Ennals’s Parliamentary answer was in fact incorrect. The cost would be 7s. 6d. a \nweek from each side and not 3s 9d. as stated. \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 181 \ngoing to find themselves in real difficulties because there was not enough margin. The \n1.3% basis was not sufficiently attractive to leave a margin and a basis of 1.5% would \nbe much better. It was a fact that the underlying premium rates increased very sharply \nwith age and if a scheme had an above-average age distribution that was a very important \nfactor and the schemes would probably not want to contract out. That was, of course, \noften the case in relation to schemes which had been established longest and which were \nvery often the best schemes, the more mature schemes, and perhaps the schemes where \nthe Government would think it most socially desirable of all that they should contract out. \nThere were several things in the Government Actuary’s report which deserved close \nreading. In 6 the Government Actuary stated: ‘I have used the distribution by age and \nearnings of employees now contracted out at age 25 and over.’ That, to him, seemed \nillogical. He would have expected the Government Actuary to have used a distribution \nbased upon all employees in occupational pension schemes rather than those then con- \ntracted out. If they followed the latter process through to its logical conclusion, each \nyear they would look at those then contracted out and they would expect to find the \naverage age distribution getting younger and younger in the future, so that the terms \ngot worse and worse! There might be some explanation for that, but it had not seemed \nlogical to him. \nIn 9 the Government Actuary stated: ‘Since the average ages for the various schemes \ntend to be closely concentrated about the break-even point, this improvement in the \nterms [from 1.25% to 1.3%] should be sufficient to make them financially acceptable to \na further number of schemes covering an appreciable number of employees.’ He found \nthat very difficult to understand because it seemed to him that for a scheme which did \nhave an above-average age distribution the increase from 1.25% to 1.3% was not going \nto make very much difference. \nMr R. W. Abbott, in closing the discussion, said that the theme for the evening had been \n‘Poverty and Progress’-a continuation of the debate which the opener had initiated in \nhis masterly paper to the Institute 2 years previously. On that occasion they had not \nknown the shape of the proposed State scheme and they had been like men seeing through \na glass darkly. A year earlier they had had in front of them the proposals for a new \nearnings-related State scheme but they had been ignorant of the terms for abatement \nand for preservation of pension rights. Therefore, their discussion in January 1969 had, \nin a sense, to be incomplete. Then with the issue of the Bill and of the accompanying \nWhite Papers, they had been able to view the proposals as a whole and to try to assess in \na detached and impartial way the contribution those proposals would make to the \nelimination of poverty and to the achievement of social and economic progress. \nIt was a vast subject and during the course of the discussion many different themes \nhad been heard. All of them could be profitably extended and developed but a closer \ncould not hope to do more than recapitulate the main themes and add a suitable coda. \nIn parenthesis, it might be commented that the treatment of the themes would not in \ngeneral have been music to the ears of the Secretary of State or to the Institute’s distin- \nguished guests from the Department of Health and Social Security, who might feel that, \nusing the opener’s phrase, members were more skilled in demolition than in construction. \nMr Barnett and Mr Gilley had suggested that in holding a sessional meeting on the \nsubject at the present time the Institute might be engaging in political controversy. \nPerhaps that was so, but if that charge were levelled they might apply to themselves the \nwords of Pericles in his funeral oration to the Athenians: ‘Here each individual is inter- \nested not only in his own affairs but in the affairs of the State as well: even those who are \n', '182 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nmostly occupied with their own business are extremely well-informed on general politics \n-this is a peculiarity of ours; we do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics \nis a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all.’ In the \nimmediately preceding sentence to that passage, Pericles observed: ‘As for poverty, no \none need be ashamed to admit it; the real shame is in not taking practical means to \nescape from it.’ So they came back to the theme of the discussion-the practical means \nof escaping from poverty and of achieving social and economic progress. \nHe said he found himself among the critics of the proposed earnings-related State \nscheme and in the strange position of being, for once in a while, amongst the majority. \nHowever, whilst he disagreed with the solution proposed by the Secretary of State, he \ndid not find himself agreeing with some of Mr Crossman’s critics either. \nIt might be useful to group those criticisms and comments under various headings. \nFirst of all, the question of complexity. Mr Langham had said that the proposed \nscheme was complicated, and he gathered that it was incomprehensible to those who had \nhad it explained to them by Mr Gilley. Complicated the scheme certainly was, and per- \nhaps it would have to be, particularly in its relation to married women’s and widows’ \nbenefits. The Government had done a great deal to explain the scheme in various docu- \nments and White Papers so that at least Members of Parliament could attempt to under- \nstand its provisions. However, it should be borne in mind that before 1972 all employers \nwith occupational pension schemes would have to be taught the elements of the new \nState scheme and that subsequently when persons qualified for benefit they would have \nto be given figures which would enable them to see that their benefit was correctly \ncalculated. If they did not understand the calculation, they would be suspicious. If they \nwere suspicious, they might become hostile, and public confidence in the fairness of the \nscheme would be jeopardized. \nIt needed to be emphasized that it was absolutely essential for the success of a scheme \nof that type that it had, and continued to have, the support of the beneficiaries and of the \ncontributing working population. More, perhaps, than any other post-war measure, the \nscheme could unite or it could divide the community at large. It followed that its com- \nplications would have to be shown to be a necessary part of a just and adequate super- \nannuation and social insurance measure. \nThat consideration led on naturally to the question as to whether the provisions of \nthe scheme in its various aspects were fair or not. The opener had dealt exhaustively \nwith that aspect on the assumption that the Government was attempting to introduce a \nscheme that was fair. Mr Gilley had said that they could not have a scheme that was \nfair at all. To the closer’s way of thinking, it was the essential issue on which the scheme \nstood or fell. As the opener had dealt so much with the question of fairness he need not go \nvery much into it except to say that he agreed with Mr Langham and disagreed with the \nopener when the latter had said that the revaluation of earnings during employment \nshould be based on a prices index rather than on an earnings index. That, of course, \nhad the merit of deferring the rise in cost of the scheme for at least 15 years, even if 10 \nmillion contributors were partially contracted-out. But since the floor and ceiling of \nearnings for national insurance purposes would change as national average earnings \nthemselves changed, they would greatly complicate the calculation of benefits if they \nrevalued them on a prices index and to that extent they might endanger the credibility \nof the scheme. It would have been useful and instructive to have had one of the dis- \ntinguished guests from the Department commenting on that proposal. \nEvery speaker except one had given his views about the terms for partial contracting- \nout and so much had been heard in so many quarters about the terms of abatement that \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 183 \nhe was tempted to say that enough was enough and to leave the subject unhonoured and \nunsung. It was, however, an essential part of their consideration of the scheme which \nperforce they could not have dealt with a year earlier. He was on record as saying that a \ncontracting-out system if acceptable to employers would, amongst other things, have \nto be both simple and financially attractive. The scheme of abatement devised by the \nDepartment in consultation with various pension bodies was, he thought, simple-and \nwas perhaps the only part of the scheme that was simple. Were the terms financially \nattractive? Here he sided with Mr Bacon and with Mr Langham. If interest rates re- \nmained at their present high levels until 1972, he thought employers would find the \nterms proposed by the Government reasonably attractive. Whether, in fact, employers \nwould contract out would depend much more on the nature of the occupational scheme \nand on the distribution of their employees by age and salary, and on other non-financial \nfactors. However, the doubt that had arisen in his own mind over the matter stemmed \nfrom the uncertainty over the Government’s likely actions in regard to the contracting- \nout terms if the level of interest rates or other factors changed. It was, of course, true \nthat the contracting-out option could be reversed, and if the terms ceased to be favour- \nable the employer could go back into the State scheme. But that would ordinarily mean an \nadjustment of the occupational scheme’s benefits for future service and would be highly \nunsettling for the members of the scheme as well as placing further work on the employer. \nIt seemed to him that it was for that reason that employers might need rather better \nterms than had so far been offered. It was because they would be thinking not so much \nof single premiums available for investment, but of annual premiums which, in 5 years’ \ntime, might have to be invested at a lower rate of interest if the Government Actuary’s \nassumptions in regard to the reinvestment rate turned out to be correct. \nA number of speakers had enjoyed themselves constructing a scheme which was some- \nwhat different from the proposed earnings-related State scheme. Mr Smith had suggested \na scheme on broadly the lines in front of them but with a smaller range, and Mr Barnett \nhad suggested a scaled-down version of the existing scheme granting more or less im- \nmediate maturity and providing for a cost which was not likely to increase over time. One \ntest of a scheme that would last was that the future cost should be no higher than the \ncurrent cost and a scheme that could achieve immediate maturity and give substantial \nbenefit to existing pensioners was to be preferred to one that, having given very little \njam yesterday, provided jam tomorrow rather than jam today. Mr Barnett’s scheme also \navoided many of the complications and incomprehensions of the Government’s current \nproposals. The Government hoped, of course, that by a process of gradualism employees \ncould, over the course of time, become accustomed to paying more without demanding \ncorresponding wage increases, and it was pointed out that in some other countries social \ninsurance contributions were at a much higher rate than in Great Britain. That overlooked \nthe fact that in those other countries contributions to occupational schemes were in \ngeneral much lower. Having recently talked to various groups of employees about the \nimpact of the new State scheme, he thought that the Government’s hope was a some- \nwhat forlorn one. Mr Barnett thought so too, and thence came to the conclusion that the \nscheme might give one more twist to the inflationary spiral. That fear reminded them \nthat it was no use attempting to alleviate poverty by measures that stultified economic pro- \ngress. The aim should rather be to devise a scheme that aided economic progress as well as \ndirecting some of the fruits of such progress towards the old, the sick and the widowed. \nHe would like to say a word about short-term and invalidity benefits, largely because \nthey seemed to have been given scant attention as compared with the attention they had \nreceived in the Institute when the Beveridge proposals were announced in 1943. The \n', '184 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nNational Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill provided for eight types of short- \nterm benefits, and there would be a separate Social Insurance Fund to meet the cost of \nthose benefits. Under Clause 8 of the Bill, the Secretary of State might by order vary the \ncontributions payable to that Fund to keep it in balance. Since the contributions were \nthen wholly based on earnings, the need to increase contributions as a result of an adverse \nsickness experience might not arise. However, the experience of the winter of 1967-68 \nwas still fresh in people’s minds when the Government had precipitately to bring in a \nspecial Bill to increase the contributions of employees and employers to prevent the \nNational Insurance Fund going into deficit. \nThe clear fact was that sickness rates had increased, were increasing and ought to be \ndiminished. A speaker in the 1943 discussion had pointed out that there was a great deal \nof difference between rates of sickness and rates of sickness claim. The financial induce- \nment to return to work had in the past kept the rates of claim below the actual sickness \nexperience. What seemed to have been happening was that rates of claim had since \n1962-63 been steadily approaching the actual rates of sickness and might then, indeed, \nbe in excess of the latter. That could arise if there was financial inducement to stay at \nhome, and the current financial inducements could be very strong. There was first of \nall the fact that sickness benefits were tax free; secondly, the employee for the period of \nhis absence from work could receive an income tax refund, and thirdly, the employer \nmight make up his pay to the full amount. \nThe trends needed to be considered in relation to the proposal to include employed \nmarried women compulsorily in the new scheme. Employed married women had notori- \nously heavier rates of sickness claim than single women and men. It seemed plausible that \nif they were to be compelled to pay contributions they did not want to pay, rates of \nclaim would rise. accordingly. The Government had tried to grapple with the problem in \na limited way in the provisions of the Family Allowance and National Insurance (No. 2) \nBill 1968. It was there proposed that the first 3 days of sickness, injury or unemployment \nbenefit should not be paid even if the absence lasted for a fortnight or more. The \nestimated saving to the National Insurance Fund at that time had been £17½ million. \nSubsequently that proposal had been dropped because of trade union opposition, and \nin the new scheme the first 3 days of flat-rate benefit were paid if the absence lasted for \n12 days or more. \nIt was the case that 60% of all employees were covered by employers’ sick pay schemes, \nand it would not be difficult to extend that coverage. If that were done, it might be pos- \nsible to exclude the first fortnight or more of sickness absence from the State scheme \naltogether. There seemed no doubt that that would reduce sickness absence which at the \nmoment was a heavy charge on the National Insurance Fund as well as resulting in a \nconsiderable loss of industrial production. \nMr Smith had referred to the question of transferability of pension rights, and had \ntime permitted he would have liked to have said something about that. One or two \nspeakers had mentioned the question of adaptation of occupational pension schemes, \nbut he felt that they had the ensuing 2 or 3 years to exchange views on the subject. \nHe realized that the President would be disappointed if he did not bring his remarks \nto a close with a quotation, preferably in a foreign language. Many years earlier, roughly \nabout 100 B.C., a writer had observed in regard to poverty: ‘Paupertas enim est non \nquae pauca possidet, sed quae multa non possidet.’ In other words, one was poor if one \ndid not possess all the goods one’s neighbour possessed. Poverty in that sense was rela- \ntive, not absolute, and by and large it was relative poverty with which they were con- \ncerned. Nothing that had been said in the discussion, he was sure, reflected upon the skill \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 185 \nwith which the distinguished guests from the Department of Health and Social Security \nhad attempted to solve the problem. He hoped that they would comfort themselves by \nthe thought that since no solution was perfect, no solution would escape criticism. Some \nof the criticisms, he hoped, had been useful. \nThe President (Mr J. B. H. Pegler) said that about 10 years previously the Institute had \nmade the proposal that a non-political expert body might be set up to advise Parliament \non pension questions. That proposal had not been proceeded with. Actuaries had been \nwidely criticized for appearing to advocate the taking of pensions out of politics. That \nhad been denied at the time, but the criticisms had been revived, and the suggestion \nitself had been revived that evening. He would like to make quite sure that it was not \nagain misunderstood. It had never been the policy of the Institute to try to take pension \nprovision generally out of politics; it was not its policy at the present time and he did not \nthink it ever would be. The main issues of pension provision ought to be discussed \npolitically and settled by the normal political process. The attendance and the vigour of \nthe discussion had made it clear that few people would disagree with the Council’s \ndecision to hold the meeting. After hearing Mr Lyon’s masterly opening, even fewer \npeople would disagree with the decision to invite him to take on that task and the \nPresident was sure that every one would wish to express their grateful thanks. \nMr Lyon thanked the President for his kind words. Talking on the subject had almost \nbecome second nature to him because he had to live with it so much, and he confessed \nthat in a way he rather enjoyed it. He had certainly enjoyed listening to the discussion \nand to the many cardinal points which he had omitted and other speakers had raised. \nNot the least of those points-and he would like to put his weight behind it-was Mr \nPingstone’s plea for a date later than April 1972, because of the sheer magnitude of the \ntask of altering schemes between the time the legislation was finalized and the date \nit came into effect. \nHe was personally rather disappointed that the discussion had concentrated almost \nentirely on the terms for abatement and such matters, because really the new scheme \nwas a design-which he thought must largely have been produced by the Department of \nHealth and Social Security rather than by the politicians-for providing adequate \ncover in misfortune for a lot of groups who could not be covered very well under occu- \npational schemes; groups such as married women, women whose marriages had broken \ndown, contributors whose health had broken down and people whose employment \nchanged frequently, although there had been suggestions for dealing with those. He did \nnot often find himself in agreement with Prof. Titmuss but one thing Prof. Titmuss had \nsaid in an article in New Society had been very much to the point; namely that social \nsecurity was very largely about women, and in the discussion they had singularly failed \nto talk about women. There might be a natural reluctance of members to discuss such a \nsubject, but he thought that they needed to think about the position of women in society \nin order to appreciate what a social security scheme was all about. \nHe had been very interested in a point somebody had made about the contributions \nthat the current generation made to the next generation in its contribution towards the \ncost of education. Clearly that could not be ignored when they were reckoning up the \nscore between themselves and their children. None the less, he still thought that it would \nbe right for the scheme to have movements within it guaranteed on a basis linked to \nprices, with the hope that they would be able to do better than that. What worried him \nwas the commitment to the use of an earnings index, not the thought that it might \nactually be applied in practice. \n', '186 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill \nHe fully agreed with Mr Smith in his reference to refunds of employees’ contributions \non withdrawal from occupational schemes. He was, of course, very much a believer in \noccupational schemes, but if they were to perform their function the leaks that were in \nthem should be plugged. It seemed to him quite a sensible idea to suggest that the tax \non a refund could be at a realistic rate, and quite possibly the younger the employee \nwhen the refund was taken the higher the rate. \nMr Lyon then returned to the journey he had taken through his opening remarks. \nHe had very deliberately referred to the 12th century document because the Exchequer \nhad originally been a board like a chess board and had been designed to count the revenue \nremitted to the Crown by the sheriffs in the days before arabic numerals were intro- \nduced. The Secretary of State had referred to pensioneering as being like a game of chess, \nso it had seemed appropriate for him to bring in the Exchequer and, indeed, the Ex- \nchequer could not be kept out of pensions anyway. He closed with a last quotation \nfrom Richard FitzNigel: ‘Perchance with the passage of time many doubtful points may \narise and questions hitherto unheard of be propounded.’ He was sure that that would be \ntrue of the Crossman scheme. \nMr A. C. Robb later submitted the following written contribution: \nOne point seems to have attracted surprisingly little comment-the Government’s \ndecision, announced in Cmnd. 3886, that, despite the best occupational schemes being \nable to match the State superannuation proposals, only one level of contracting-out \nwill be permitted, i.e. partial contracting-out. The only justification offered was that ‘a \ntwo-tier arrangement . . . would be much too complicated’. \nTo secure tax approval, occupational schemes must comply with rules enforced by the \nInland Revenue. These are made under Section 388 of the Income Tax Act 1952 which \nlays down certain conditions for approval, one being that ‘the aggregate value of the \nbenefits afforded by the scheme is reasonably comparable to the aggregate value of the \nbenefits usually afforded by statutory superannuation schemes in like circumstances’. \nTax considerations are so important to an occupational scheme that none of any size can \nafford not to be approved. \nThus, effectively, the public sector schemes set the pace for approval, and hence for \nthe maximum benefit provisions, of private sector schemes. Within the public sector the \npresent-day schemes have evolved to some extent independently, so that there are con- \nsiderable internal variations in detail. Nevertheless there is a general overall corres- \npondence in worth; this is an almost inevitable result of staff pressures. In the future, \nthere may well be an even greater degree of uniformity (except perhaps for the specialized \nschemes for police and firemen), since in pay negotiations the increasing emphasis placed \non the principle of comparability within the public sector presupposes comparability \nof fringe conditions such as pension arrangements. Public sector schemes, as elsewhere, \nare being reviewed in the context of the proposed new State scheme. A vast amount of \nthought, work, consultation and legislative drafting will be needed in order to produce a \nseries of essentially parallel schemes for the various public services. In these circum- \nstances, there would seem to be much to be said for evolving a ‘national’ public sector \nscheme as a wholly contracted-out alternative to the National Superannuation scheme; \nand for this to be opened, on suitable terms, to employers outside the public sector. For \nbrevity I will refer to such a national public sector scheme as ‘the public scheme’. \nThe present public sector schemes are already effectively dynamized to the date of \nretirement, and this position will presumably continue. Pensions in payment are from \ntime to time supplemented, at the expense solely of the former employer, under a series \n', 'National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 187 \nof Pensions (Increase) Acts; these are rightly criticized as ‘too little and too late’. At the \nReport stage on the latest of these measures (the Act of 1969) the Paymaster General, \nlooking to the future, said that ‘We want to replace (the present) system with something \nmuch better, with something which guarantees to the public service pensioner regular \nincreases when he ought to have them.’ This would seem to imply that the Government \nwould wish to see the public sector schemes brought broadly into line with their National \nSuperannuation proposals, i.e. in providing, as a minimum, post-award inflation-proof- \ning of pensions. Since the Government are responsible for managing the national \neconomy it can be argued that inflation emerges as the result of their failure to manage; \nmoreover, inflation automatically increases the Government’s revenues from taxation– \nat least until such time as it is recognized that non-dynamized monetary terms are as out \nof place in the taxation field as in social security, e.g. in relation to personal allowances, \nthe bands of taxable income attracting reduced rates of tax, and the level of income at \nwhich liability for surtax commences. It would therefore not seem unreasonable to pro- \nvide for an Exchequer contribution to the public scheme which should, at the least, \ntake the form of a guarantee against deficiencies attributable to inflation. On this basis it \nwould be feasible to prescribe a fixed contribution to be paid to the public scheme by \nemployer and employee jointly; the division between employer and employee in a par- \nticular service would be a matter for mutual negotiation, e.g. where a scheme is non- \ncontributory, as currently for the civil service, the employer would bear the whole. The \npublic scheme might need to provide some latitude, reflected in levels of contributions, \nin fixing the normal retirement age appropriate to particular employments. \nThe Government, in Cmnd. 3886, imply that they wish to encourage the develop- \nment of occupational schemes-they could scarcely do less, in view of the dependence \nof the national economy on the savings generated by such schemes; so that, given a \nwholly contracted-out public scheme of the above nature, there is no reason why \noptional membership should not be extended to employments outside the public sector. \n(A limited precedent for this already exists, since approved semi-public employments \ncan be admitted to the present local government scheme.) But a particular employer \nmight feel that because of, e.g. special investment facilities, he could provide the national \nlevel of benefits for a lower contribution; or, alternatively, he and his employees might \nprefer a locally-administered scheme in order to counter possible allegations of remote- \nness. Full contracting-out might therefore be made available for such employments, \nsubject to an actuarial certificate that the aggregate value of the benefits under the \noccupational scheme is reasonably comparable to the aggregate value of the benefits \nunder the public scheme; and such occupational schemes should qualify for an Ex- \nchequer contribution corresponding to that made to the public scheme in respect of \ndeficiencies attributable to inflation. It should, of course, be a pre-requisite that such \noccupational schemes should be fully funded; and where, alternatively, a present funded \nscheme enters the public scheme, unfunding should be prevented as contrary to the long- \nterm national interest. It would seem to follow that the public scheme should itself be \nfully funded; this would involve funding the teachers’ scheme which is now only \n‘notionally’ funded, and funding the present unfunded schemes for the civil service and \nand national health service (and also for the police and firemen if these specialized \nschemes could be effectively assimilated). \nI would suggest that, irrespective of whatever arrangements are made for partial \ncontracting-out, on this basis full contracting-out would be feasible with a very consider- \nable overall saving in administrative costs and complications. \n']</pre>
