The\neffect of the new tariff law on the\nhigh cost of living and on industrial\nlaws furnished the material for soir.s\nlively passages today in the senate.\nSenator Smoot produced a pam\nphlet setting forth that reduction of\nv.ool and woolen duties would not\nresult in a material reduction in the\ncost of clothing. Senator Stone of\nMissouri interrupted him.\n"When the tariff bill was on the\nlloor," said Mr. Stone, "the Republi\ncans were prophesying industrial anl\nfinancial disaster as a result of tire\nmeasure. How can the senator now\nsay that prices will not be reduced.\nWe have seen nothing of the closed\nfactories, the ruined mills or the\nsqualid soup houses the senator\npainted so vividly. Now he tells us\nthe cost of living is not reduced.\nWhy, the average standpat Republi\ncan, if he prays at all, is muttering\nsupplications to the skies day and\nnight, that a panic may fall upon thj\ncountry. But no panic is in sight.\nThere will be no panic. Let the sen\nator withhold his prophecies as to\nthe cost " of .living until we can. see\nthe real results of the Democratic\ntariff law."\n(Glasgow Western Company\nIn Another Legal Mix-up\nThe Glasgow-Western company, a\ncorporation operating in sever?!\ncounties of Nevada, is having more\nthan its measure of legal compli\'M-\nlions, due largely to the methi.il- j\nconducted by its representative, li;\nis the company which recently had :i\nlot of miners haled before the Fed\neral court for encroaching on their\nplacer ground near Battle Mountain.\nIn this they lost out after putting\nthe miners to thosands of dollars ol\nexpense.

Mana\nger Van Nagel of the Riverside Mill\ncompany plans to secure from the\nprofessors of the university some\ndata on the principles of dry farm\ning to be used in furthering the in\nterest in this class of agriculture.\nIt is found that the wheat raised\nby dry farming, especially if it is of\nthe best varieties, is a hard wheat,\nfull of gluten, and approaching in\nquality the Kansas turkey red wheat\nwhich is imported at considrable ex\npense for the higher grades of flour.\nOn the contrary the wheat which\nhas been irrigated is soft and low in\ngluten. Mr. Van Nagel believes that\nthe raising of wheat with as few ir\nrigations as possible will improve\nthe product, and he is seeking a\nmeans of placing more of the right\nkind of information among the far\nmers of the state.\nThe only dry farm wheat he has\nsecured in Nevada this year was haif\na dozen carloads from the vicinity\nof Wells. He also purchased dry\nfarm wheat from eastern California.\nGazette.\nWITH DISPLAY OF\nTT\nCO VENES\nTwenty-Seven Members, .Mostly of\nCatholic Party, Fail to Attend\nHuerta Explains Why He Dis\nmissed Former Body\nMEXICO CITY, Nov. 21.

It was more in the na\nture of a business meeting between\nthe president and the men converted\ninto law makers by the recent so\ncalled elections. The message Gen\neral Huerta bore to them was in its\nessence an admonition. The incide-n\nhe related to them of the dissolution\nof the previous congress was one by\nwhich iv was intimated they might\nbe guided in their conduct as con\ngressmen. Catholic Senators Absent\nThe reply of the speaker, Eduard\nTamariz, was brief. Not all the con\ngressmen were present. Twenty\nseven, the majority of whom were of\nthe Catholic party, failed to put ;n\nan appearance. It had been announc\ned that the Catholic members had\nheld a meeting and decided not to\nparticipate in the. session. That gave\nrise to the baseless rumor that\nSpeaker Tamariz would not preside, j\nas he is a member of that party. t\nGeneral Huerta drove from the pal-j\nace to the chamber through files of\nsoldiers most of whom were detailed\nfrom the crack Twenty-ninth regi\nment which participated in the coup\nd\'etat at the palace in February.\nHe entered the building while the\nbands were playing the national air.\nLittle Pomp Shown\nAcknowledging the plaudits and\nvivas of the congressmen and spec\ntators as he moved dowon the aisle\nby a series of military salutes, in\nstead of the grave bows which char\nacterized his old chief, Porfirio Diaz.\nGeneral Huerta looked a stern figure.\nLike the congressmen he -was in ev\nening clothes, the only touch of rank\nbeing the tricolor ribbon across his\nIn-east.

Outside the building\nthroughout the session a strong force\nof soldiers guarded all the an\nproaches; patrols \'rode rhe streets\nfor sevral blocks around, and still\nother troops were stationed in little\ndetachments further out.\nCongress Aid Pledged\nIn his reply to the message, the\npresident of the chamber, Senor Tam\niriz, assured General Huerta of the\ncooperation of congress.\n"If ever should reign in congress a\npatriotic ideal." he said, " in these\ncircumstances, it ought to predomi\nnate as never before and above all\nother sentiments."\nTo the congress he said:\n"Without doubt, upon your work\ndepends largely that the country,\nwith the aid of its good sons, should\nmake a supreme effort, in order not\nto fall in the ruin and humiliation\nwhich threatens it. On this account\nyou come here animated by the pur\nest patriotism, prepared to lay aside\nambitions, personal interests and\neven rancor, in order to work unit\nedly for a supreme ideal the preser\nvation of our nationality."\nWASHINGTON, Nov. 21. The\nWashington government believes the\npower of the Huerta government is\nslowly "crumbling and disintegrat\ning."

Final\npreparations were made today for\nthe battle over the currency bill on\nthe floor of the senate which will\nbegin Saturday. Three separate currency-\nbills, all based on the same\ntheory, will be placed before the sea\nate by the divided banking and cur\nrency committee.\nUnable to \'agree on amendments,\nthe committee will present the\nGlass-Owen bill as originally endors\ned by the administration and passed\nby the house . The measure with\nable to the president will be submit\namendments assumed to be accept\nted by Chairman Owen and five oth\ner Democrats of the committee,\nSenators Pomerene, Hollis, Reed,\nO\'Gorman and Shafroth. A bill ma\nterially changing the structure of the\nhouse measure will be presented b;y\nthe Republicans, Senators Nelson,\nWeeks, Bristow, McLean and Craw\nford, and Senator Hitchcock, Demo\ncrat.

He left here sev\neral weeks ago and nothing was heard\nof him until checks from Battle\nMountain; Elko and other points\nwith his signature attached began\narriving at the Carson Valley bank,\nat which place he had no funds.

The bills\npropose to put the entire system un\nder the control of the federal reserve\nboard to be appointed by the presi\ndent. Although agreeing as to the pur-,\nposes to be accomplished by the pro\nposed legislation, the three plans dif\nfer in almost every point in attempt\ning to carry out these purposes. As\nit passed the house, the Glass-Owen\nbill proposed the creation of twelve\nregional banks. The Democrats of\nthe senate cut them down to eight,\nthe minimum number the president\nwas willing to accept.

The flardnerville postmastership is undoubtedly a pretty\ngood billet, this is a Democratic year, a Democratic president is\nin the White House, and when the senators from Nevada went\nto him and asked for the appointment of one of their supporters\nfor the position,\' Mr. President got busy and gave it to them. And\nby the way, a better appointment than that of Mr. Todd could\nnot have been made, aud he was really and truly deserving of it,\nthough not an applicant. lie has been a long tried and consistent\nDemocrat, one of those it is a pleasure to meet and do business\nwith, and the Appeal can say, without reserve, that he will give\nthe people of Oardnerville good service.\n13ut why there should be any protest from the Republicans\nis a problem beyond the ken of the Appeal. The Democrats of\nthe United States worked awfully hard for the success of their\nticket in last fall\'s elections, and being successful they naturally\nwanted the emoluments in the shape of jobs that went with their\nvictory. Hasn\'t that been Republican doctriue? When Cleve\nland and the rest of the Democrats went out of business in the\nspring of 181)7, sixteen years ago, did the Republicans hold back\nand continue in the offices they occupied? They did exactly what\nthe Democrats are doing now. They were hungry for pie and they\nleft no stone unturned until they got it. That\'s the way of poli\ntics; always has been and always will be.\n-oo-\nTHE BIG EXPOSITIONS\nAlthough the big expositions to be held in California in 1913\nare more than a year away, Nevada is already beginning to feel\nu benefit from them.\nCalifornia cattle men have been scouring the state for cattle,\noffering a higher price than ever before and they find sellers\nholding for higher figures and a shortage in the beef supply all\nover the coast.\nThey reason that in 1915 many millions of people will visit,\nthis coast that have never been here before and they will have\nto be fed beef, butter, flour and poultry for a starter and many\nmore things thrown in. Nevada will supply a great deal of the\nbeef and mutton for the exposition. In fact, the extra demand\nwill tax its resources to the limit and everything raised in the\nsagebrush state will find a ready market in San Francisco and San\nDiego at the highest figures ever reached for the last quarter of\na century.\nIn fact, it is doubtful if Nevada can any more than supply\nthe demand of the traveling public as it passes through here on\nits way to California. It is estimated that twenty millions of\npeople will come from all parts of the world to visit San Fran\ncisco and nearly half as many will take in San Diego. The San\nFrancisco exposition will run nine months and the San Diego\none year. San Diego depends much upon the patronage of the\ngreat South American republics while San Francisco will enter\ntain the world.\nSan Diego will draw a great deal upon southern Nevada for\nsupplies and if these two great shows do not enrich Nevada to an\nextent heretofore undreamed of then all signs go for nought.\nIt will be a banner year for everyone who produces anything\nfor human consumption. The dairy men are already beginning\nto look ahead. Milch cows that were selling at $50 last spring\ncommand $75 and $80 now and are hard to get. There will not\nbe a milch cow of any grade in the state next year that can be\nhad even at those figures. There is a stiffening of prices every\nwhere and Nevada will benefit at least a million dollars by those\ntwo expositions.\n-oo-\nTHE MARCH OF PROGRESS\nWhen the first message was flashed over the Atlantic ocean\nby a cable reaching along the bottom of the sea for thousands of\nmiles it took the people of the country some time to realize that\nwe could thus exchange the babble of two hemispheres. This was\nmany decadea ago and the triupmh of the Field cable has ceased to\nbo a novelty.\nNow comes the news that a Marconi wireless message has\nbeen flashed across the Atlantic and read from one shore to\nanother.\nWe are also informed that a German company is planning\na fleet of aeroplanes to carry passengers across the Atlantic, and\nexpect to make the trip in sixty hours. They can compete in\nprices with the ocean liners. It will not be many years before\nthe ocean liners will be too slow for passengers and mails and\nonly carry freight. The world appears to be a going concern.\noo\nThe next thing in order is the naming of a U. S. district\nattorney to succeed Sam Piatt, the present incumbent. For many\nyears Nevada was singularly unfortunate in the selections of her\nIT. S. attorneys. All shades of political opinions, however, agreed\nthat Piatt has made an honest and efficient official and cleared\nthe office of much of the odium that was previously attached to\nit. The Appeal hopes that the senators in selecting his successor\nwill see to it that the man who takes his place is equally honest,\nand efficient and we candidly admit that in order to do so a great\ndeal of care must be taken in the selection.\n-oo-\nMrs. Piexetto, the schoolteacher in New York, who was dis\ncharged for the crime of becoming a mother has been reinstated\nby order of the supreme court. Fourteen other teachers go back\nto teach under the same decision.

He said to .Mr. Summer-field,\n"I saw by your ad that you are willing to meet mail order com\npetition. Here is a list of goods with prices from a mail order\nhouse in San Francisco, with freight added. I prefer to trade at\nhome if you can give me prices anywhere near these. Of course\n1 want you to make a profit and don\'t expect you to duplicate\nthese prices." Taking tl, list Mr. Summerfield ran through it\nand replied: \'"This is easy. We meet these prices every day and\nmake a profit, too." The der was filled, the man selected his\ngoods, knew exactly whui !.. was getting and didn\'t have to wait\nten days to 1v:o weeks for the arrival of his goods. Besides it\ngoes to show that the management is keeping its word as adver\ntised in this paper and is not afraid of the "so-called" cheap prices\nof mail order concerns. This is not an ad for the Mina Mercantile\ncompany, but it is used to show that Mina has a live, wide-awake\nlot of business firms all of whom believe in advertising and make\ngood their word.
