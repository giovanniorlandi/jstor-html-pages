They Will Oppose, Admission to Statehood., The democratic territorial com, mi t tee in New Mexico has arrayed, itself against the admission of that, territory under the bill now pend, ing in the senate, says the Denver, Republican editorially., It bases its opposition upon the, failure of this bill to provide for, certain relatively unimportant mat, ters which the people of the pro, posed state can easily provide for, in their state constitution. This, action should convince republican, members of the senate that the, democrats fear they would be una, ble to control the state government, if New Mexico should be admitted, at this time., Opposition to the admission of a, new state should not be based on, considerations of partisan politics,, but if matters of that kind are to, be considered, the case of New, Mexico presents nothing to which, a republican member of the senate, can object. It would be republican, if it should be admitted and hence, the republican party would be, strengthened in both the senate, and the house and also in the elec, toral college., The opposition which has been, f-hown by some persons to the ad, mission of New Mexico is so un, reasonable that one can hardly, speak of it with patience. Espe, cially is this the feeling of republi, cans in Colorado and other west, ern slates who appreciate the im, portance of opening the doors of, the union to that territory at the, present time., New Mexico has been a territory, for fifty years. Its people have, waited long for that recognition as, a state which should have been, given them years ago. Its progress, in material resects and its growth, in population have been retarded, by the perpetuation of a territorial, form of government. As long as it, remains a territory it will be a, province of the federal government, and its people will be subjected to, a species of political servitude which, is equally in violation of their rights, as American citizens and an unjust, reflection on their patriotism and, intelligence., The senate committee on territo, ries) will consider the admission, bill in the early days of the winter, session, in tne meantime every, friend of New Mexico, Arizona and, Oklahoma should bring to bear, whatever influence he may be able, to exert in behalf of a favorable re, port. The attention of republican, senators should be directed to the, recent action of the democratic ter, ritorial committee, so that any, lurking fear of increasing the, strength of the democracy in con, gross and the electoral college may, be removed. All three of the terri, tories ought to be admitted, and, the enabling act should be sent to, the president for his signature be, fore the Christmas holidays. Al, buquerque Citizen., Pythian Officers., Twenty-eight officers and mem, bers of the supreme lodge, Knights, of Pythias, passed through Will, iams last Sunday on their way to, San Francisco to attend the great, convention. In the party were F,, C. Neal, president of the board of, control; R. E. Spaulding, clerk, in the endowment rank; Con, gressman WaUon, of Indiana; J. J, Brown, of v andalia, 111., one of the, wheel horse republicans and a sen, atorial aspirant from that district;, Judge E. D. Meyers, of Blooming, ton, 111., past supreme chancellor;, W. W. Blackwell, of Henderson,, Ky.; Frank B. Hoskins. of Fon du, Lac, W is., and C. S. Hardy, attor, ney for the endowment rank of the, Knights of Pythias. There were, number of ladies in the party. The, special was side-tracked at Flag, staff long enough to allow a visit, to the cliff dwellings and other, points of interest, arriving here in, time to be attached to the regular, Canyon train., A number of other specials pass, ed through, enroute west, some of, which visited the Canyon as did a, large number of Pythians traveling, on regular trains., Wants to Find Her Boy., Editor News, Williams, Ariz., Dear Sir I write to make in, quiries regarding a young man by, the name of Charles Mann. He is, 28 years of age and left home 16, years ago. Have not heard from, him for 14 years. Any information, concerning his whereabouts will be, thankfully received by his mother,, Mrs. Alice Mann,, Wagoner, I. T., Territorial papers please copy., Dismissed for Hazing., Washington, Aug. 4. President, Roosevelt today returned the papers, in the case of Alexander G. Pen, dleton, Jr., to the war department, with the endorsement confirming, sentence of dismissal. Pendleton, is a first class cadet at West Point,, and was found guilty of hazing., He was appointed from Arizona., . . Correspondence ., mm v, Grand Canyon, Aug. 7,, Nearly all train crews have thrill, ing experiences at different times, in their career, but few have such, shock to their nerves as a crew, whose run is out of Los Angeles,, Shortly after leaving the city the, baggageman noticed something, oozing from the bottom of a trunk, in the baggage car which very much, resembled blood. On closer in, spection he decided it was blood, and hastily called the conductor,, A consultation was held and they, thought it best to have the trunk, put off at the first station they, came to, as it looked to them as if, a dark, foul deed had been com, mil tea and that the trunk con, tained a dead body., The coroner was notified by tele, graph to come immediately. The, crew having thus far attended to, the matter, ordered the train to, proceed on its way and they left, the scene of horror. The coroner, took the first train out and was not, long in reaching the station desig, nated. He carefully opened the, trunk and began to solve the mys, tery, which at first seemed nothing, more than several layers of some, lady\'s wearing apparel., with their hats on the coroner, and his assistant began to search, further, and with bated breath went, down into the trunk until they, nearly reached the bottom., Here they found the cause of, their trouble. Underneath was a, row of cracked jars of raspberry, jam, from which the juice had run, out through every available place., They breathed a sigh of disgust, and the lid went down with a slam, as the coroner realized the tragedy, had ended in a glass of raspberry, jam., lhe owner of the trunk was, speeding away on the train that, had so ruthlessly put her trunk off, and dreaming happy dreams of the, good fruit she had packed away for, her friends, little thinking the cor, oner was dissecting it., Now comes the news that the, Grand Canyon is to be reproduced, in miniature at the Worlds fair, in St. Louis. We do not know, what the Canyon will think of this, being taken and laid along beside, the Mississippi river with its nu, merous "I\'s" (eyes). The Canyon, might say that it had not always, been the dead looking thine it, seems to be, but had plenty of life, at one time. These two rivers, would have much to tell one an, other if they could, both running, as they do through such entirely, different scenes. One runs for sev, eral hundred miles through banks, on either side covered with all kinds, of trees and vegetation; while the, other makes its way through richly, tinted rocks and deep, dark can, yons. The scenes of the Mississippi, are changed by the seasons, while, the Colorado is constantly chang, ing by shadows from the sun., It is like old times again with, the full trains of passengers that, come up every evening recently., We are having a goodly share of, Knights on their way to Califor, nia, and there are many more to, come., We have had some new neigh, bors added to our little colony, in, the family of Mr. Lumsden, the en, gineer on the Canyon run., The guests of Bright Angel hotel, indulged in a social dance nearly, every evening for the past week,, there being a small local orchestra, willing to play for them., Mrs. Buggeln returned to the, Canyon with a party of friends and, her daughters last Tuesday., RHOADES., Aug 7, 1902., II.

Dr. Tyroler attended., The Rev. R. W. Illingsworth. of, Phoenix, who has charge of the, missionary work for the Presbyte, rian church in this territory, is, spending the week here. He is here, n the interest of his work and is, holding services every evening.]', '[On the Fence, Were you ever on the fence, undecided, yet anxious for a, decision one way or another?, Such a position is all the worse, when suctt-ss or failure hangs upon, vour decision.

In the United, States the average cost is only, $0.73 per ton per 100 miles, or less, than. 40 per cent of the average cost, in Europe., Prescott\'s new land office offi, cials officially walked up stairs yes, terday and the old ones unofficially, walked down stairs. This time the, chaps who reached the ground floor, were no longer "it." The retiring, officials seem to have filled their, places all right. The new ones are:, Register, Fen S.

Between 50 and, 100 men will return to work., Sad Plight of the Tucson Star., As a partisan newspaper, the, Tucson Star has become a political, derelict. The thin thread by which, it has been clinging to the demo, cratic party has been broken by, Col. Wilson\'s repudiating the ac, tion of the Star in refusing to sign, the scale submitted by the union, and by the fight being waged, against union labor. The republi, cans have refused to allow this, sheet to break into their ranks, and, it now appears that our morning, contemporary has right ahead the, roughest course of its checkered, career. hue the Tost does not, stand for bovcott, it cannot ignore, the conditions which have brought, it about. The Star has refused to, recognize the union, and as a re, sult is losing many subscribers and, advertisers. We do not wish to, gloat over the misfortune of a con, temporary newspaper as some other, papers may do. It, however, seems, clearly evident that the Star has, made a grave mistake, and it might, be well for the editor of that paper, to reconsider his action even at this, late date and to come into the fold, of union labor.
