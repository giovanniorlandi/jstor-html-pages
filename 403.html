        <pre>['84\nOver the past 20 years, the Catholic Church \nin Latin America has lost millions of its \nmembers to Protestant denominations, \nespecially to Pentecostal churches. In a number\nof countries in the region—including Brazil, \nArgentina, Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, and \nNicaragua—Protestants \ncomprise more than 10 \npercent of the population. \nGuatemala today is close \nto one-third Protestant, \nwhile Brazil, which is more than one-quarter Protestant,\nhas by virtue of its huge size one of the larg-\nest populations of Protestants in the world.\nIn 1990, the anthropologist David Stoll posed \nwhat was then a startling question: Is Latin America\nturning Protestant? Nearly two decades later, \nthe answer is clearly a qualified yes. But an affirmative\nresponse generates its own series of ques-\ntions. If this is Latin America’s Reformation, as \nsome scholars have suggested, should we expect \nto see the region undergo something similar to the \neconomic and political upheavals that transformed \nsixteenth-century Europe? How do religious competition\nand pluralism affect politics in this par-\nticular region of the global South?\nChurChes in the marketplaCe\nBefore beginning to address such questions, we \nshould hasten to observe that the Roman Catholic \nChurch in Latin America is hardly dying on the \nvine. To look at the figures above in reverse, Guatemala\nremains two-thirds Catholic, and Brazil is \nthe largest Catholic nation on earth. Indeed, religious\npluralism has been in many ways good for \nthe Catholic Church. It has had to learn how to \ncompete with Protestants for bodies and souls.\nParadoxically, while national census figures in \nalmost every Latin American country show a lower \npercentage of Catholics than ever before, those who \ndo identify themselves as Catholics today are more \nlikely to be actively engaged with their faith and \nwith the church as an institution than people were \nin the past—when the only religious choices were \nparticipation or indifference. To use the framework \nof rational choice theory, a “deregulated” religious \nmarketplace (known informally as the “religious \nsupermarket”) has produced genuine religious pluralism,\nbut it has also forced the Catholic Church to \nbe a more aggressive and effective competitor. The \nCatholic Church has been the dominant religious \ninstitution in Latin America throughout the region’s \nhistory. The church’s social and political influence \nhas been, and continues to be, profound. \nThis is not to suggest, however, that all is well \nwithin Latin American Catholicism. On the contrary,\na great rift remains between ordinary Cath-\nolics and the church hierarchy. The heyday of \nliberation theology—the church’s emphasis on \nbringing social justice to the poor, often through \npolitical activism—is now some 20 to 30 years \nin the past. Yet the impact of radical theology is \nstill very much felt in Latin America, and it is a \ncontinuing source of friction between the Vatican \nand the local clergy. A recent example was Rome’s \ncensure in March 2007 of Jon Sobrino. Sobrino, \na Spanish theologian who has lived and worked \nin El Salvador for many years, is one of the most \nprominent living proponents of liberation theology.\nThe Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of \nthe Faith, the overseer of church doctrine, recently \ndescribed his work as “dangerous and erroneous.”\nIn some ways, the Catholic Church now is as \nbifurcated as ever. Many grassroots Catholics in \nthe region embrace popular expressions of CatholiVirginia\ngarrard-Burnett, an associate professor of his-\ntory at the University of Texas at Austin, is the author of On \nEarth as It Is in Heaven: Religion in Latin America (Rowman\n& Littlefield, 2000).\n“Latin America may . . . be ‘turning Protestant,’ but it is not poised for a \nEuropean-style Reformation, at least not politically speaking.”\nPriests, Preachers, and Politics:\nThe Region’s New Religious Landscape\nVirginia garrard-Burnett\nReligion  \n       and State\nFifth in a series\n', 'The Region’s New Religious Landscape • 85\ncism such as devotion to folk saints and the Virgin \nMary, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal (which \nborrows heavily from the liturgical styles of Pentecostalism),\nor today’s more temperate version of \nliberation theology. The church hierarchy in Latin \nAmerica, on the other hand, is deeply conservative. \nIt reflects the sharp theological and social turn to \nthe right that began under Pope John Paul II and \nthat continues under the ideologically kindred \nPope Benedict XVI. Because the vast majority of \nLatin America’s current bishops and cardinals were \nnamed and consecrated during John Paul II’s long \nreign, Pope Benedict’s relations with the bishops \nare cordial and amenable. The Catholic Church’s \ngreat challenge, however, is to regain the hearts \nand minds of ordinary people.\nThough not an impossible task, it is an improbable\none. Protestantism since the 1960s has dra-\nmatically changed the social—and increasingly the \npolitical—environment of Latin America. This is \nespecially true of Pentecostalism,\na branch \nof Christianity that \nemphasizes the “gifts of \nthe Holy Spirit,” such \nas speaking in tongues, \nfaith healing, prophecy, \nand ecstatic forms of \nworship. Indeed, the vast majority of Latin America’s \nProtestants are Pentecostals: The World Christian \nDatabase estimates that 73 percent of Protestants in \nthe region practice “spirit-filled” Christianity.\nPut another way, Pentecostals make up about 13 \npercent of Latin America’s population of nearly 560 \nmillion. Pentecostalism has gained this following \nalmost exclusively since the 1960s. Although Pentecostal\nexpansion has slowed somewhat in absolute \nterms in some parts of Latin America, the movement \ncontinues to steadily attract new members throughout\nthe region. As the historian Andrew Chesnut \nhas wryly noted, “The Church chose the poor, but \nthe poor chose the Pentecostals.” \nthe “invasion of the seCts”\nInevitably, the expansion of religious pluralism \nin a region that was once as universally Catholic \nas Latin America has provoked both dire prognostications\nand triumphalist rhetoric from both \nsides about the kinds of changes that Protestantism \nmight or should bring to that part of the world. \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Catholic bishops \nopenly spoke of the possibility of an impending \n“holy war” between Catholics and Protestants. \nPope John Paul II reflected the opinion of much of \nthe Catholic world when he referred to Protestant \nexpansion as an “invasion of the sects” that was \nout to destroy Latin America’s culture, heritage, \nand social cohesion.\nIn fact, most Latin American Pentecostal \nchurches do not have their roots directly in the \nmissionary movement (though many do have ties \nto international church organizations). The us \nProtestant denominations that sent the most missionaries\nto Latin America during the nineteenth \nand early twentieth centuries, such as the Presbyterians,\nMethodists, and Baptists, have a relatively \nsmall presence there today. The one exception is the \nPentecostal Assemblies of God, perhaps the largest \nChristian denomination in Latin America outside of \nthe Catholic Church.\nNevertheless, there is an enduring popular association\nin the region between Protestant Chris-\ntianity and the expanding hegemony of North \nAmerican culture and \npolitical views. On the \nother side of the equation,\npopular Pentecos-\ntal preachers in Latin \nAmerica promise transformation\nfor nations \nas well as individuals. \nThey call on the Almighty to rain down tangible, \nconcrete blessings on God’s people, such as sobriety, \nmaterial prosperity, and even good government. \nThe political implications of Latin America’s relatively\nnew religious pluralism are potentially quite \ndramatic, but they are as yet mostly unrealized. \nThis was evident in a 10-country survey of world \nPentecostalism conducted by the Pew Forum on \nReligion and Public Life in October 2006. Pew’s \nresearch included a detailed study of three Latin \nAmerican countries: Brazil, Chile, and Guatemala. \nIt indicated that, although Pentecostals possess, \nnot unexpectedly, a somewhat different political \nworldview from that of their non-Pentecostal compatriots,\ntheir political activism nonetheless defies \n“simple categorization.”\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s—a \nperiod of traumatic political violence in such \nnations as Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, \nArgentina, and Chile (all places that, interestingly, \nnow have sizable Protestant populations)—many \nscholars and activists charged that Protestants, \nand especially Pentecostals, tended toward political\npassivity and quiescence, or even exhibited an \noutright preference for authoritarian, right-wing \nEvangelicals are neither as politically  \nquiescent nor as supportive of authoritarian \n government as some have suggested.\n', '86 •\u2002 CURRENT\u2002HISTORY\u2002 •\u2002 February\u20022008\ngovernments. More recent scholarship, however, \nbolstered by a careful reading of political events, \nsuggests that these theories were misleading. In \ngeneral, Pentecostals have been both slow to organize\npolitically and difficult to pigeonhole when \nthey do.\nAs the Pew Forum survey notes, “Latin America’s\nPentecostals have had very different growth \npatterns and theological emphasis, and have also \nexperienced very different political contexts. The \nresult has been a great diversity of Pentecostal \npolitical styles and forms of activism. This diversity\ncontinues to evolve in ways that bear impor-\ntant long-term consequences for Latin American \nsociety and politics.” A closer look at this diversity \nin three Latin American countries—Guatemala, \nBrazil, and Mexico—may shed some light both on \nquestions of religious pluralism and competition \nand on the impact that religion is having, or could \nhave, on politics in the region.\nCharismatiC politiCians\nGuatemala is, arguably, the “most Protestant” \ncountry of Spanish-speaking Latin America. \nApproximately 30 percent of the population is \nProtestant, mostly Pentecostals. They are distributed\nthroughout all sectors of Guatemalan society, \nacross lines of race, class, ethnicity, and political \npersuasion. The movement that some scholars \nhave called Guatemala’s “Protestant Awakening” \nbegan in earnest in the 1960s, but it took off exponentially\nafter a catastrophic earthquake in 1976, \nand it accelerated during a 36-year civil war that \nreached its dark nadir in the early 1980s.\nCharismatic religion, not only Pentecostalism \nbut also Catholic Charismatic Renewal, expanded \ndramatically in Guatemala during the 1980s and \n1990s. Today, according to the Pew Forum survey, \n“renewalists”—including Pentecostals and Catholic\ncharismatics—account for approximately six of \nevery ten Guatemalans. More than 80 percent of \nProtestants are either Pentecostal or charismatic, \nand six in ten Catholics surveyed can be classified \nas charismatic.\nWith such a substantial Pentecostal minority, it \nis perhaps not surprising that Guatemala has been \ngoverned by not one but two evangelical presidents\n(in both Spanish and Portuguese, evangélico \nrefers to any Protestant). The first of these, General \nEfraín Ríos Montt, a born-again Pentecostal and \nthe brother of a Catholic bishop, oversaw the military’s\nscorched-earth policy that nearly defeated \na Marxist guerrilla insurgency and killed tens of \nthousands of Mayan Indian and other noncombatants\nin 1982 and 1983.\nAlthough many hold Ríos Montt and the Guatemalan\narmy responsible for the genocidal mas-\nsacres, Ríos Montt remained a popular political \nfigure in the country until quite recently. His surprisingly\nresilient popularity stemmed from two \ncharacteristic features of his presidency in the early \n1980s. The first was an austere policy of law and \norder that dramatically reduced street crime. The \nsecond was Ríos Montt’s evangelical discourse, in \nwhich he demanded an end to public corruption \nand called for Guatemala to claim its place as a \n“nation anointed by God.”\nRíos Montt’s paradoxical popularity within the \ncountry, and his ineligibility to run for president \nafter the return of civilian government in 1986, \nresulted in the election of a second evangelical, \nJorge Serrano Elias, to the presidency in 1990. \nElected largely because of his religious credentials—Guatemalans\nerroneously believed that Ser-\nrano Elias, as an evangelical, would fight official \ncorruption—he was forced to resign in 1993 after \nhe tried to suspend the constitution and dissolve \nthe Congress and Supreme Court. \nThe long shadow of Ríos Montt, who continued \nover the years to petition to run for president—and, \nto a lesser extent, the legacy of Serrano Elias—cast \na pall over evangelical political organization in Guatemala\nfor at least two decades. During the 1980s, \nwhile chief of state, Ríos Montt had courted evangelicals\nto serve as part of the counterinsurgency \ncampaign. Although many evangelicals refused, \nand some joined the guerrillas, enough of them \neither actively supported the military campaign or \nretreated into the relative safety of political passivity \nto engender a legacy of extreme conservatism and \npopular mistrust that has been hard to shake.\nEvangelicals in Guatemala have also long been \nassociated in the popular imagination with virtues \nsuch as honesty, integrity, and hard work. These \nwould seem to translate into valuable political \ncapital. However, divisions within the Protestant\ncommunity—not only between Pentecostals \nand mainline Protestants, but also among various \nchurch-related sectors and alliances—continued \nfor many years to prevent any significant coherent \npolitical organization among evangélicos. \nIt was not until the 2003 presidential election \nthat a potentially viable evangelical candidate again \nattempted to actively bring together evangelical \nsupport in the political arena. This election was \ncomplicated by the candidacy of none other than \n', 'The Region’s New Religious Landscape • 87\nGeneral Ríos Montt himself, whom the Guatemalan\nSupreme Court finally, under some pressure, \npermitted to run for the presidency in July of that \nyear. At the same time, his former adviser and fellow\nchurch member Francisco Bianchi organized \na new political party, the Movement for Principles \nand Values, to appeal directly to Guatemala’s large \nevangelical minority. Both candidates stumbled \nbadly in their efforts. Ríos Montt won less than 20 \npercent of the vote in the first electoral round and \nwas dropped from the race. Bianchi failed so completely\nto assemble an effective coalition that the \nPrinciples and Values movement ultimately was \nnot able to field a candidate in the election.\nIn the 2007 election, yet another evangelical candidate,\nHarold Caballeros, the popular pastor of the \nGuatemalan Pentecostal megachurch El Shaddai, \nattempted to rally support for a presidential bid. \nBut Caballeros—despite substantial funding, good \nname recognition, and a reputation for honesty—\ndropped out of the race because of a lack of support.\nCaballeros says he \nwill try again in 2011. \nBut his failed candidacy \nsuggests that the evangélicos,\neven though \nthey have become an \ninfluential force in Guatemalan\nsociety in many areas, do not yet have a \ncommon political will, agenda, or interest. Perhaps, \ngiven their nation’s history, they still lack the stomach\nor desire to mobilize for united political action. \nBrazil’s numBers game\nIn terms of absolute numbers, Brazil not only \nhas the largest Protestant population in Latin \nAmerica; it has one of the largest populations of \npracticing Christians in the world. Brazil is the \nworld’s most populous Catholic nation, but the \npercentage of Catholics in Brazil has been dropping\nat an accelerating rate since 1980. According \nto the 2000 national census, about 74 percent of \nBrazil’s population of 170 million is Roman Catholic,\nwhile just over 15 percent is Protestant.\nWhile this Protestant percentage is relatively \nlow compared to a country like Guatemala, it \nreflects the dramatic increase in religious competition\nthat Brazil has experienced over the past \nquarter century. Censuses indicate that the Catholic\nshare of Brazil’s population decreased by 4 per-\ncentage points between 1960 and 1980 (dropping \nfrom 93 percent to 89 percent). Over the following\n20 years, the Catholic share of the population \ndeclined by 15 percentage points (from 89 percent \nin 1980 to 74 percent in 2000).\nThe rapid decline in the Catholic share of the population\nhas been accompanied, unsurprisingly, by a \ncorresponding growth in the number of Protestants. \nIn Brazil, as in much of the rest of Latin America, \nthese Protestants tend to be Pentecostals. As in Guatemala,\neight out of ten Brazilian Protestants identify \nthemselves as either Pentecostals or charismatics. \nHowever, the lower Catholic figure reflects rapid \ngrowth not only in the percentage of Protestants \nbut also in the category of “non-affiliated” (which \nincreased from 0.5 percent in 1960 to 1.6 percent in \n1980 and 7.4 percent in 2000). This figure, significantly,\nincludes people who are mainly practitioners \nof Afro-Brazilian religions and those who profess no \nreligion at all. (This latter category is not insignificant:\nOne of the options in a deregulated religious \nmarket includes not consuming any product.) \nNevertheless, it is religious competition between \nCatholics and Protestants that continues to define \nthe Brazilian religious \nmarket—a competition \nthat, in recent years, \nhas found expression \nin the political arena \nas well. Twenty years \nago, Brazilian evangélicos\nwere unlikely to seek out political involvement, \nbelieving such temporal endeavors to be “too much \nof the world.” Today, at least some sectors of Brazil’s \nProtestant population are more likely than before \nto channel their emerging demographic and social \npower into political mobilization. \nmegaChurChes in the ring\nOne factor that distinguishes Brazilian Protestantism,\nespecially Pentecostalism, is the presence \nof several international megachurch denominations\nthat have Brazilian origins and project their \nmessage worldwide. These denominations feature \nstandard Pentecostal “signs and wonders” such as \nfaith healing and speaking in tongues. But they \nalso promote exorcism and “prosperity theology” \n(the belief that success in business or personal life \nrepresents external evidence of God’s favor) across \nthe world, especially in Africa.\nOne of the largest and most prominent of the \nBrazilian Pentecostal megachurches, the Universal \nChurch of the Kingdom of God (Igreja Universal \ndo Reino de Deus, or iurd), has a global presence\nthat extends to Europe, Asia, and the United \nStates, as well as throughout the rest of Latin \nIn Mexico, a reinvigorated Catholic Church \n does not seek control over the body politic.\n', '88 •\u2002 CURRENT\u2002HISTORY\u2002 •\u2002 February\u20022008\nAmerica and much of Africa. Within Brazil itself, \nthe iurd has been not at all reticent about engaging\nin social and political activism. The iurd owns \nand controls a vast media empire, including radio \nand television outlets and publishing operations \nthat produce books, newspapers, and magazines. \nSo large is the iurd in the Brazilian imagination \nthat, several years ago, one secular television station\ncreated a popular telenovela built around the \nfictionalized foibles of the iurd’s controversial but \ncharismatic founder, Edir Macedo. \nAlong with several other large Pentecostal \ndenominations, the iurd entered the political \narena during the presidential election of 1998 by \nsupporting Fernando Collor de Mello and opposing\nLuiz Ignácio Lula da Silva, whom the churches \nopposed because of his socialist predilections. That \nsame year, the Brazilian \nEvangelical Association \nissued a “Decalogue”—a \nsummons of sorts—for \nBrazilian Christians to \ninvolve themselves in the \npolitical process by casting\nan “ethical vote.” To \nsome observers, the challenge\nappeared to represent a call to arms for Brazil’s \ngrowing Protestant population, urging direct political\nengagement, perhaps even by bloc voting.\nHowever, with Lula’s eventual election to the \npresidency in 2002, the iurd prudently threw its \nsupport behind the leftist president, with whom it \nenjoys cordial relations today. Lula’s vice president, \nJosé Alencar, is a member of the Republican Party \n(formerly the Liberal Party), which has close ties \nto the iurd. Indeed, although this party is not an \nexpressly “evangelical” party and is not sponsored \nby any church, the iurd regularly used the Liberal \nParty as a vehicle to get its members and clergy \nelected to public office. \nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, Brazilians,\nhoping for an end to corruption and a more \ncoherent vision for their country, elected some 60 \nevangelical candidates to the National Assembly. \nHowever, a spate of scandals in 2006 involving \ncandidates from the iurd and the Assemblies of \nGod tarnished the prestige of evangelical politicians\nand seriously reduced their voter appeal. As a \nresult, the 2006 elections produced far fewer Protestant\nwinners than in the past.\nThese losses—combined with the lack of a unified\nevangelical political agenda and a continued \nreticence on the part of many Protestant Brazilians \nto place trust in the political process—suggest that \nthe immediate future does not bode particularly well \nfor evangelical political formation. Perhaps Brazilian\nevangelicals will follow the lead of their Catho-\nlic brethren by positioning themselves as a powerful \npolitical influence in the country, but without forming\na unified political bloc or organized party.\nCatholiC Caution\nMexico provides a very different sort of case \nstudy in religious change and political participation. \nProtestantism has made relatively few inroads in \nMexico, compared to many other countries in Latin \nAmerica. Pockets with high rates of Protestant conversion\nexist in a few regions—most notably Chia-\npas, Oaxaca, and Tabasco—but the country remains \noverwhelmingly Catholic. According to the 2000 \ncensus, more than 90 percent of Mexicans are Catholic;\nonly 5 percent of the \npopulation identify themselves\nas Protestants.\nMexicans, moreover, \nare not post-Christian \nEuro-style Catholics: \nMexican Catholics tend \nto be active in their faith. \nAccording to a 2006 \nstudy, nearly two-thirds of Mexicans attend church \nat least once a month; nearly half attend Mass once a \nweek or more. And these figures do not include the \nlarge numbers of Mexicans who regularly engage in \nthe many practices of popular Catholicism that lie \noutside the bounds of the institutional church. As of \n2006, more than four-fifths of Mexican voters identified\nthemselves as Catholics, while only 8 percent \nof voters said they were Protestants. \nGiven this profile, one might expect the Catholic \nChurch to be a major player in the Mexican political \narena, but this, in fact, is not the case. Despite Mexicans’\npronounced allegiance to Catholicism and \ntheir strong Catholic identity, the same 2006 study \ndemonstrated that Mexicans, in general, do not \nview religion as an important factor in the formation\nof their political values. Nor do they consider \nreligious leaders or institutions to be influential in \nframing political preferences or discourses. The reason\nfor this disconnect—in such sharp contrast to \nthe United States, where religious leaders and organizations\nactively, and successfully, seek to influence \npolitical behavior—rests in Mexico’s long and contentious\nstruggle to separate church and state in the \nnineteenth century and the state’s aggressive suppression\nof the church in the twentieth. \nThe debacle of the Cristero Rebellion of the \n1920s, during which radical Catholics violently \nThe political implications of Latin  \nAmerica’s relatively new religious  \npluralism are potentially quite dramatic,  \nbut they are as yet mostly unrealized.\n', 'The Region’s New Religious Landscape • 89\nattempted to oppose the anticlerical reforms of \nthe Mexican Revolution, led to further violence \non the part of the government and to the strict \nlegal repression of the institutional church. As a \nresult, the Catholic Church was relegated to the \nsidelines of the political arena in Mexico for almost \nthe entirety of the twentieth century. The process \nof reconciliation was slow, and it was not until the \ncentury’s final decades that the Catholic Church \nwas able to meaningfully reestablish itself in a position\nof some political influence.\nIn 1990, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari \nacknowledged the church’s political rehabilitation \nwhen he annulled many of the anticlerical laws of \nthe revolutionary period and sought to normalize \nrelations with the church as part of a larger package \nof substantial political transformation. The church, \nnevertheless, has retained a relatively cautious political\nposture to this day. The Catholic Church rarely \nlevels direct criticisms against Mexico’s government \nand it generally demurs from aggressively endorsing \nopposition political parties or candidates.\nThat said, the Mexican Catholic Church has, \nduring the two most recent presidential elections \n(2000 and 2006), played an important role in \ninfluencing voter behavior. This was true especially\nin 2000 when Vicente Fox ran for presi-\ndent. Fox was the candidate of the National \nAction Party (pan), which, because it was formed \nfrom the remnants of the Cristero movement, is \nthe closest thing Mexico has to a “Catholic party.” \nDuring the campaign, the Catholic Church, \naccording to a recent study by the political scientist\nRoderic Ai Camp, played a fundamental role \nin helping people to overcome the “fear factor”—\napprehensions about voting against the Institutional\nRevolutionary Party (pri), which had held \npower in Mexico for more than 70 years.\nAccording to Camp’s study, Mexican voters listened\nto the church not for overtly political rea-\nsons—that is, people’s votes had little to do with \nwhat one might think of as hot button political \nissues, such as abortion or immigration—but simply\nbecause Mexicans invest more confidence and \nauthority in the Catholic Church than in any other \npublic institution. Nevertheless, Camp found that \nMexican Catholics who are “intensely” religious—\nmeasured by how regularly they attend Mass—did \nvote decisively for the more conservative, proCatholic\npan in the 2006 presidential election. \nProtestants, on the other hand, defied the scattered \npatterns of Protestant political mobilization that \nwe find elsewhere in Latin America. They voted \noverwhelmingly for the pri.\nBoth of these tendencies were significant, especially\nin a race determined by fewer than 250,000 \nvotes out of a national population of more than 100 \nmillion people. Nevertheless, the fiercely contested \n2006 presidential victory of Felipe Calderón, the \npanista candidate, was decided in the end not so \nmuch by “religious” voters as by the much larger \nnumbers of moderate and indifferent Catholics and \nthe small but vocal minority of “non-religious” voters\nwho actively supported the winning candidate. \nThe impact of “intensely religious” voters, both \nCatholic and Protestant, was measurable but circumscribed.\nAs Camp concludes, religious differ-\nences and the Catholic Church “exerted influence \non the 2006 presidential campaign. These influences,\nhowever, do not reflect the typical percep-\ntion of religion’s role in Mexican politics.”\nContra the yanqui model\nWe might well pose the question of just what \nthis “typical perception” is. Certainly, the examples\nof Guatemala, Brazil, and Mexico should \nprovoke us to reconsider some of the tropes that \nmany observers, particularly in academia, share \nabout how religion influences public life in Latin \nAmerica. The Catholic Church, losing customers \nand clout in the region’s deregulated religious marketplace,\nis not as powerful behind the scenes as \nmany believe it to be. And Protestantism, for the \ntime being anyway, has proved too diffuse to bring \nabout significant political change in the region. \nLatin America may indeed be “turning Protestant,” \nbut it is not poised for a European-style Reformation,\nat least not politically speaking.\nAs the situation in a country like Guatemala \nindicates, evangelicals are neither as politically \nquiescent nor as supportive of authoritarian \ngovernment as some have suggested. In Brazil, \na country that a few years ago seemed ready for \nlarge-scale evangelical political mobilization, \nProtestant leaders now appear more interested in \nstrategizing within existing party channels than \nin using their faith’s numbers, money, and power \nto dramatically reshape the political landscape. \nIn Mexico, a highly religious country with a stridently\nsecular history, we see that a reinvigorated \nCatholic Church may dominate hearts and minds, \nbut it does not seek control over the body politic.\nOnce again, we might observe that religion \nand politics in Latin America continue to defy \nthe North American model, as church leaders and \ninstitutions participate in the political arena but \ndo not exhibit the political will to try to redefine \nit—at least not yet. ■\n']</pre>
