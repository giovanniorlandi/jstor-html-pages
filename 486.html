        <pre>["Stalin and Tito repeat \nthe Stalin-Trotsky story\nBehind the Tito^Stalin Feed\nBy WAYNE S. VUCINICH \nAssistant Professor of History, Stanford University\nO\nn J une  28, 1948, the Cominform re\xad\nleased its declaration attacking Mar\xad\nshal Tito and his leading lieutenants for de\xad\nviating from the principal tenets of Marx\xad\nism-Leninism and for pursuing an unfriend\xad\nly policy toward the Soviet Union. Since \nthen the breach has grown progressively \nwider. The Communist Parties of individual \nEast European countries have attacked the \nYugoslav Communist leadership. Trade be\xad\ntween Yugoslavia and the U.S.S.R. and its \nsatellites has deteriorated. The Fifth Con\xad\ngress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia \nhas unanimously approved the policies pur\xad\nsued by Marshal Tito. All these events \nthrow additional light on the main issues \nwhich gave rise to the controversy.\nThe Soviet Union is the country of the \ndictatorship of the proletariat, and it is the \nonly such country in the world. The Yugo\xad\nslav regime is defined as “a people’s democ\xad\nracy,” and it has served as a model for the \nnew regimes in the other countries of East\xad\nern Europe. The Cominform, prompted by \nthe All-Union Communist Party (Bolshe\xad\nviks), has tried by its attack on the Yugo\xad\nslav Communist leadership to establish the \nU.S.S.R. as a direct model to be followed by \nall other countries of the Soviet sphere of \ninfluence. The entire controversy boils down \nto the crystal clear fact that the Soviet gov\xad\nernment cannot afford to tolerate any devia\xad\ntion from its own version of Marxism-Len\xad\ninism. This condemnation has been designed \nto compel all the other countries of the \nSoviet orbit to abandon the Yugoslav \nmethod of comparatively slow socialization \nand to try to emulate the Soviet system as \nrapidly as possible.\nThe question underlying the Cominform- \nYugoslav controversy can thus best be \nanswered by an analysis of the differences\nbetween the “dictatorship of the proleta\xad\nriat” (Soviet system) a l the “people’s de\xad\nmocracy” (Yugoslav system, heretofore lib\xad\nerally copied by Albania, Bulgaria, Hun\xad\ngary, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, and Po\xad\nland). Both systems have the same ' Joret- \nical ideal: full socialism in its Ma;- ver\xad\nsion growing into Communism. nods, \nhowever, are different in many details. An \nanalysis of the Soviet and Yugoslav Con\xad\nstitutions reveals the following pertinent \ndifferences:\n(1) While the Soviet Constitution states \nthat all power in the U.S.S.R. belongs to the \nworking people (Article 3), the Yugoslav \nConstitution uses the unqualified term “the \npeople.” (Article 6);\n(2) Unlike the Soviet Constitution, the \nYugoslav basic law does not use the terms \n“socialist,” “socialism;”\n(3) While the Soviet Constitution recog\xad\nnizes the Bolshevik Party as the “vanguard \nof the working people” (Article 126), the \nYugoslav Constitution does not mention the \nCommunist Party or any other political or\xad\nganization;\n(4) In contrast to the Soviet Constitu\xad\ntion, the Yugoslav basic law states that “pri\xad\nvate property and private initiative in econ\xad\nomy are guaranteed.” (Article 18).\nThese differences, fundamental as they \nare, contain the clue to the basis on which \nthe Cominform condemnation was formu\xad\nlated. The attack on the Yugoslav Commu\xad\nnist Party was centered on its acceptance of \nsome basic features of capitalism, particu\xad\nlarly in agriculture, and on its submergence \ninto the National Front.\nIn contrast to the Soviet Union, where \nthe land belongs to the state and is given \nto the collective farms (the kolkhozy) for \n“permanent use,” the land in Yugoslavia be-\n213\n", '214 Current History, October, 1948\nlongs to those who till it. This means that \nYugoslavia, as an agricultural country, has \nremained a land of predominantly private \nproperty. Thanks to the agrarian reform \ncarried out under the present regime’s aus\xad\npices, the number of privately held peasant \nholdings is higher than before the war. In \n1936 Yugoslavia had 1,985,725 individual \npeasant holdings; at present, the official es\xad\ntimates are two million. All these peasants \nand their families, embracing approximately \n75 per cent of the total Yugoslav population, \nare the owners of the basic means of pro\xad\nduction and so, in Marxian terminology, are \npotential capitalists. Although the spokes\xad\nmen of the Yugoslav government admit that \nno full-scale economic planning in Yugo\xad\nslavia can be effectively put into practice \nbefore agriculture has been collectivized, \nthey have deliberately selected a method of \ngradual change within the rural community. \nDuring the last three years the emphasis \nhas been on the organization of rural co\xad\noperatives. At the end of 1947, according to \nthe official Yugoslav sources, rural coop\xad\neratives had 2,200,000 members and they \nsupplied approximately 10,000,000 con\xad\nsumers.1\nRURAL COOPERATIVES\nIt must be emphasized that most of these \ncooperatives follow the pattern established \nin Western Europe rather than the Soviet \nkolkhozy. They are of four types: consum\xad\ners’ cooperatives, credit cooperatives, pro\xad\nducers’ cooperatives, and peasants’ working \ncooperatives. Only the last named type im\xad\nplies the pooling of the means of production \nand creating a form of collective farms. \nSince the Yugoslav government authorities \nhave exerted no pressure on the land-tillers \nto create peasants’ working cooperatives, \nthis movement has not taken wide propor\xad\ntions. It is a clear manifestation of the re\xad\nluctance of the Yugoslav peasant to venture \ninto collective enterprise.\nAt the end of 1947 there were only 808 \nsuch cooperatives embracing a total of 40,- \n642 peasant holdings with 209,526 members. \nThese peasants’ working cooperatives dif\xad\nfer from the Soviet kolkhozy in that their\ni Edvard K ardelj. "O  poUoprivredi,”  Narodno \nzadrugarstvo, May, 1948. p. 8.\nmembers by the law are permitted to with\xad\ndraw from them after three years of mem\xad\nbership. They are of four types: (a) the co\xad\noperatives in which the land is collectively \ncultivated but still remains the property of \nindividual families; (b) the cooperatives in \nwhich the land becomes cooperative prop\xad\nerty but the produce is divided annually \namong the individual families in accordance \nwith the acreage and quality of their origi\xad\nnal land; (c) the cooperatives which rent \nthe land from individual holders; and (d) \nthe cooperatives created by new colonists in \nVoyvodina, Yugoslavia’s granary, in which \nevery trace of original ownership is oblit\xad\nerated. The last-named category is the only \none which really resembles the Soviet kolk\xad\nhozy. At the end of 1947, however, they \nnumbered only 351, and embraced 28,606 \nfamilies holding 249,383 hectares of land.\nThe Agricultural Machine Stations, a \nYugoslav version of the Soviet Machine- \nTractor Stations, have been used by the \ngovernment as instruments for the control \nof agricultural production and for strength\xad\nening socialist ownership in the rural com\xad\nmunity. These stations, originally supplied \nby U.N.R.R.A. tractors, have thus far taken \na very small part in agricultural production. \nThe main reason for this is the difficulty in \nreplacing old and procuring new tractors \nand other agricultural machinery.\nThe 1948 regulation obliging the peasants \nto sell a part of their produce to the govern\xad\nment at the prices determined by the latter \nhas been criticized by the Cominform as \ndisplaying “capitalist” features. According \nto this regulation, issued on June 3, 1948, \nthe peasants are obliged to sell to govern\xad\nment purchasing agencies or ts> cooperatives \nfrom 10 to 85 per cent of their produce, de\xad\npending on the size of the holding. The peas\xad\nants may enter into “contracts” with gov\xad\nernment agencies, however, for sale of their \nproduce before the harvest takes place, and \nin this case they receive 25 per cent above \nthe designated price. But no more than 6,500 \nkegs of wheat can be delivered by “con\xad\ntract.” The authorities have apparently de\xad\nvised this technique to forestall any chan\xad\nneling of farm surplus into the black mar\xad\nket. From the Soviet point of view, the giv\xad\n', 'Behind the Tito-Stalin Feud 215\ning of comparatively favorable prices for \nfarm produce to non-socialized peasants \nmay only mean the strengthening of rural \n“capitalism,” and the postponement of the \nsocialization of agriculture.\nIt must be borne in mind that the Yugo\xad\nslav rulers, preoccupied with consolidating \ntheir political power, and faced with a tra\xad\nditionally conservative peasantry which is \nready to oppose any reforms unfavorable to \nprivate property, deem it unwise to venture \nat present into any radical changes of so\xad\ncio-economic relations on the countryside. \nAll their reforms directly affecting the vil\xad\nlage have thus far been designed to rally the \npeasantry behind the regime. The eagerness \nof the government not to alienate the peas\xad\nants has been motivated by the fact that at \nthis time it has no other social group to turn \nto for support. Yugoslav industrial labor, \nwhich according to Marxism-Leninism is \nexpected to be the vanguard of socialist so\xad\nciety, numbers approximately one million \nand has virtually no trade-union tradition. \nThe peasant rather than the worker was \nthe main factor in the guerrilla warfare \nagainst the Axis occupation forces. The so- \ncalled “national committees,” a Yugoslav \nversion of Russian soviets, were first or\xad\nganized in .the rural community. These na\xad\ntional committees were, the first organiza\xad\ntions through which the present regime \ngained control of the country. The intelli\xad\ngentsia is still a treacherous ally of the new \nregime. Rich classes are definitely elimi\xad\nnated. Tito and his advisers, therefore, count \nheavily on the support of the peasantry. It \nis no secret, however, that the present re\xad\ngime is planning to undertake more radical \nsocial and economic reforms in the coun\xad\ntryside once it has acquired the support of \nthe intelligentsia and once it has created a \nformidable and reliable labor movement. \nIt is planning on taking its time in dealing \nwith land collectivization and this is one of \nthe basic reasons why it met with disap\xad\nproval from the Soviet Communist Party \nand its agency, the Cominform.\nAnother significant Cominform criticism \nis directed against the Yugoslav leaders’ \nviews on the organization of the Communist \nParty. They are criticized for (a) submerg\xad\ning the Communist Party into the National \nFront, (b) maintaining for the Party a \nsemi-secret status, and (c) conducting their \nparty meetings undemocratically.\nThe National Front, an outgrowth of the \nNational-Liberation Council created during \nthe war to back up the Partisan resistance \nto the occupation forces, is a Communist \nfront organization skillfully devised by the \npresent regime to appeal to the principal \nsegments of Yugoslav society. It is an inte\xad\ngrated front embracing the labor syndicates, \nthe anti-fascist women’s organizations, the \nyouth movement, the traditional political or\xad\nganizations which have accepted the Com\xad\nmunist guidance in Yugoslav political and \neconomic life, and, finally, the Communist \nParty. The National Front is, according to \nMosha Piyade, the leading Marxist of the \ncountry, “ an integrated national political \norganization which is dominated and led by \nthe Communist Party. The National Front \nis an alliance of workers, working peasants, \nand working intelligentsia; it is a special, \nindipensable form of this alliance corre\xad\nsponding to the needs of a people’s democ\xad\nracy. It is a firmly built alliance of commu\xad\nnist and non-Party working masses of \ntowns and villages.”2\nTHE NATIONAL FRONT\nThe history of the National Front is the \nhistory of the growing entrenchment of the \nCommunist elements within it. The Comin- \nform’s assertion that the Yugoslav Com\xad\nmunist Party’s hiding behind the National \nFront will lead to its weakening may im\xad\npress an inexperienced observer as an indi\xad\ncation that the Yugoslavs have been pro\xad\nmoting a diluted version of Marxism-Len\xad\ninism. Nothing, however, is further from the \ntruth. The Yugoslav Communists subscribe \nto the Marxian dogma in no way less than \ntheir Soviet teachers. They have devised the \nNational Front not to abandon Communism \nbut to rally non-Communists behind the \npresent regime and thus to forestall the crys\xad\ntallization of any other political movement.\nThe Yugoslav authorities have created the \nNational Front because the Communist \nParty was too small, insufficiently integrat\xad\n2 Borba. Ju n e 12, 1948, p. 2.\n', '216 Current History, October, 1948\ned, and had negligible appeal to the Yugo\xad\nslav people. Suppressed during the inter\xad\nwar period, the Communist Party was in \nno position to grow into a mass organization. \nDuring the same period it was torn by con\xad\ntinuous internal strife between its leaders. \nTito became its Secretary General as a re\xad\nsult of a compromise between the clashing \nforces within the leadership. The small \nranks of the Party were virtually decimated \nduring the guerrilla warfare. Its ranks be\xad\ngan to swell in 1945 when the Partisan vic\xad\ntory in Yugoslavia was assured. The present \ngovernment could not rely solely on the re\xad\njuvenated Communist Party for support, be\xad\ncause the latter requires thorough reorgan\xad\nization and the cleaning of its ranks from \nopportunists. At the same time, the eco\xad\nnomic reconstruction of the country requires \nmany expedient measures, including occa\xad\nsional compromises with “capitalist” ele\xad\nments. It was more advantageous for the \ngovernment to use the National Front in\xad\nstead of the Communist Party to support \nthese compromises.\nThe “hiding” of the Communist Party be\xad\nhind the National Front has become a stand\xad\nard practice among the other East Euro\xad\npean pro-Soviet countries. The Czechoslo\xad\nvak Communist Party has gone only recent\xad\nly to the polls as a part of the National \nFront. Dimitrov’s Communists in Bulgaria \nhave done exactly the same thing. Why, \nthen, did the Cominform single out the \nYugoslav Party for attack? The answer is \nsimple: Yugoslavia is the creator of the so- \ncalled people’s democracy and of the new \nversion of the “integrated” National Front.\nRUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS\nMosha Piyade, in an article published in \nBorba on June 12, 1948, undertook to answer \nthe charges of the All-Union Communist \nParty of the U.S.S.R. two weeks before they \nwere made public by, and under the auspices \nof, the Cominform. By an extensive quoting \nof Stalin he has made a detailed compari\xad\nson between the “dictatorship of the pro\xad\nletariat” and the “people’s democracy.” He \nendeavored to show how the “people’s de\xad\nmocracy,” in its fundamental principles and \npractices, corresponds to the “dictatorship\nof the proletariat” in 1926, before the col\xad\nlectivization of land was undertaken on a \nlarge scale. The only difference, according \nto Piyade, is that in 1926 the Bolshevik \nParty was not covered by the semi-secrecy \nwhich covers the Yugoslav Party of 1948. \nThis is, however, a reflection of the differ\xad\nence in political strategy rather than of the \ndifference in the Communist hold of the \ncountry. The Communist leadership in the \nYugoslav National Front was and is very \nconspicuous.\nIn other words, the position of the Com\xad\nmunist Party in Yugoslavia in 1948 has been \nin no way weaker and less conspicuous than \nthe position of the Bolshevik Party in 1926, \nat the time when Stalin described the So\xad\nviet regime as a dictatorship of the prole\xad\ntariat. It took the Soviet authorities eight \nyears to build a system which Yugoslavs \nbuilt in four years. It seems that the Soviet \nrulers, eager to consolidate their hold over \nEastern Europe, are trying to force their \nsmall neighbors to establish the Soviet sys\xad\ntem through an accelerated process. This \nseems to explain why they are trying to \ndiscourage the Communist Parties of their \nsatellites from “hiding” behind the National \nFronts, and why they want them to carry on \ntheir revolutionary activities to the ut\xad\nmost.\nIt should be stressed that the activities of \nthe Yugoslav Communist Party do not rep\xad\nresent a deviation from Marxism; they only \nrepresent a more cautious, more gradual \nway in achieving Marxian socialism. It is \npertinent to note that Yugoslavia, despite \nthe fact that it was singled out for attack \nby the Cominform, has come nearer to the \nSoviet system than any other East Euro\xad\npean country. The political structure of the \ncountry is a replica of the Soviet system. \nThe Yugoslav Constitution, with the ex\xad\nception of the above-mentioned differences, \nis a wholesale imitation of the Soviet Con\xad\nstitution. In both countries the parliaments \nare rubber-stamping institutions for the \nlaws and decrees promulgated by the cabi\xad\nnet. Furthermore, in both countries the cab\xad\ninet is dominated by and is an agency of the \nPolitbureau of the Communist Party. Yugo\xad\nslavia has accepted in toto the Soviet prin\xad\n', 'Behind the Tito-Stalin Feud 217\nciple of federalism, whereby various nation\xad\nalities have acquired autonomies reduced al\xad\nmost exclusively to cultural life. In both \ncountries the trade unions are government \nagencies and centers for Communist educa\xad\ntion of the working class. In both countries \nthe press is not allowed to deviate from the \nCommunist line, and religion, while not \nsuppressed, is considered as belonging to \nthe weak and socially decadent.\nHowever, the society which the Yugoslav \nCommunists are trying to change in accord\xad\nance with Marxian blueprints differs in \nmany respects from the Russian society of \nthe pre-revolutionary period. Feudalism \nwas virtually non-existent in Yugoslavia \nduring the last quarter of the century, and \nin some people’s republics, particularly in \nSerbia, during the last hundred years. The \nYugoslav peasant has had a much broader \npolitical experience than his Russian coun\xad\nterpart. According to Sir John Maynard, \nthe traditional Mir, the village commune, \nhas prepared the Russian peasant for land \ncollectivization. Such village communities \nwere never known in Yugoslavia. Serbia \nhad a successful experiment in peasant de\xad\nmocracy during the first two decades of the \ntwentieth century, and the Croat peasant \nmovement of Styepan and Ante Radich has \nnot yet been forgotten by the Croat peas\xad\nant. In Czarist Russia the peasant did not \nhave any such political experience. Further\xad\nmore, the Soviet regime has had to contend \nonly with the Russian Orthodox Church, \ntraditionally subservient to the state, and \norganized on a purely national and indige\xad\nnous basis. The Yugoslav regime has had \nto contend not only with the traditionally \nsubservient Serbian Orthodox Church but \nalso with a powerful Roman Catholic \nChurch. It claims 37 per cent of the popula\xad\ntion as its members. All these differences \nare fundamental, and as such they stand as \na serious hindrance to any effort to imitate \nthe Soviet model in its entirety. The Comin- \nform charges, however, clearly indicate that \nthe Soviet rulers will not be satisfied be\xad\nfore Yugoslavia and other East and South\xad\neast European countries apply fully the \nStalinist reworking of Marxian principles \nacclimated to the Russian weather.\nIn its crusade against Marshal Tito the \nCominform, serving as a mouthpiece of the \nBolshevik Party, has scored its first victory: \nYugoslavia has ceased to serve as a model \nto other East and Southeast European coun\xad\ntries in their efforts to build up Marxian so\xad\ncialism. The deposition of Tito and full liq\xad\nuidation of Titoism, as the ultimate goals of \nthe current crusade, will most probably not \nbe achieved, at least in the near future. All \nevidence points to the fact that Tito is be\xad\ncoming stronger as a result of the Moscow \nand Moscow-inspired attacks. While he may \nhave lost some of the “orthodox” Stalinists, \nhe certainly has gained many supporters \namong those Yugoslavs who oppose Moscow \nas the guiding force against the national \nindependence of their country.\nThe Tito-Stalin feud is in its principal \naspects analogues to the Stalin-Trotsky con\xad\ntroversy, with the difference that at present \nStalin is criticizing Tito for exactly the same \nthings for which he was criticized by \nTrotsky. Super-nationalism, deviations from \nMarxism-Leninism, emphasis on the peas\xad\nantry at the expense of the proletariat, and \nthe lack of democratic procedures in the \nParty councils were the main points in Trot\xad\nsky’s protracted struggle against Stalinism. \nMoreover, Tito’s reply to Stalin differs in no \nsignificant aspects from Stalin’s reply to \nTrotsky in 1926. As is well known, the \nStalin-Trotsky feud took months and years \nto come to a head. When finally Trotsky and \nhis group decided to recant, their recanta\xad\ntions were too late. Thus far it seems that \nthe Tito-Stalin conflict has been taking \nwider and wider proportions. Repentance on \nTito’s part may come too late. As the present \ntrend indicates, the crack in the Iron Cur\xad\ntain is growing wider, but though Tito has \nlost prestige in the circles of international \ncommunism, he has enhanced his position in \nYugoslavia.\nNatives in Malaya believe that the most effective charm they can carry against \ntiger attacks is some form of letter written on government paper. The superstition \nclaims that the more important the government department, the more certain is the \ncharm.\n']</pre>
