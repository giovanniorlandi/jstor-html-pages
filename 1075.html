In less than seven months it had\nestablished the reputation of being the most popular car in Hawaii and was\nvoted as such in a contest recently held in Honolulu.\nThe instantaneous success of the Paige is based on\nfour fundamental principles BEAUTY-POWER\nNDURANCE--ECONOMY-a combination of\nstylish design and mechanical excellence that heretofore\nhas only been available in higher priced cars.\nThe Paige motor represents the sum total of cur\nrent engineering knowledge. It is a strictly modern\nachievement- product of the combined genius of two\nContinents and the most efficient power plant in the\nwodd.\nThe beauty of the Paige is apparent at first glance\nIndividuality is the keynote of the design of all models,\nyet nothing freakish or revolutionary is embodied; the\ndictates of conservative artistic tastes alone have been\nfollowed.\nEconomy of operation is always an important con\nsideration and the owner of the Paige is assured of ex\ncellent results in this respect. Not only is the consump\ntion of gasoline, oil and tires extremely low, but the big\ngest item of maintainance cost, the repair bill, is seldom\nencountered. The Paige, despite its beauty, is built to\nwithstand the roughest sort of usage and will perform\nsatisfactorily under any conditions.\nThe Newton Auto Exchange, Ltd. of Honolulu,\nwhose integrity is unquestioned, stinds\' solidly behind\nevery Paige put on the market. Mr. Lee Newton,\nPresident of the company, and Mr. A. B. Corcoran,\nsales manager, will personally bring ten Paige cars of\nvarious models to Kauai on Wednesday in order that\nthe motorists of the Garden Isle may have an oppor\ntunity to become intimalely\'acquainted witrrthe "Most\nBeautiful Car in America."\nThese cars will only be available fora limited time\nand will undoubtedly be sold almost immediately upon\ntheir arrival. It will be worth your while to call for a\ndemonstration and place your order at once.\nThese Models are Available for Immediate Delivery\nFIVE PASSENGER TOURING SEVEN PASSENGER TOURING\nFOUR PASSENGER SPEEDSTER\nMR.\nADDRESS OR CALL\nA.

HOPPER\nManaging Editor\nTUESDAY\nJULY 20, 1920\nVR0H1BITI0S,TI1E DUTY\nOF THE COURT\nManifestly the aim and jutt-posc of prohibi\ntion ia to prohibit, not to regulate or restrain\nthe manufacture and sale of liquor, but, to pre\nvent the same. To this end the law provides\nsuch penalties as are supposed to be prohibi\ntive, leaving however to the court a liberal\nrange of discretion in the imposition of them.\nThe law provides that any person who\nmanufactures or sells liquor in violation of the\nlaw shall be subject to a fine of not more than\n.? 1.000, or imprisonment not to exceed six\nmouths. Very much depends on the attitude\nand outlook of the court as to what the punish\nment shall be. It may bi merely nominal in\nwhich case the moonshiner pays the fine, ac\ncepts it is a legitimate expense of the business\nraises his price perhaps, and goes ahead again,\nnot taxed or discouraged in the least, but\nharder to catch the next time.\nManifestly that kind of enforcement of the\nlaw defeats the very, purpose of it. We want\nprohibt ion. We want to stop the manufacture\nand sale of liquor, not to raise the price, or in\ncrease the risks, but kill the business.\nThe effective way, manifestly, is to give the\nmoonshiner so strong a dose of the law that he\nwill never want another. For these disloyal\nand criminal gentry we dout want a course of\ntreatment so gentle and considerate that it\nwill act as an appetizer or tonic, to stimulate\nto fresh and larger violations of the law. We\nwant them to understand that the law means\nbusiness and that it is a "knock out" policy\nfrom the word go.\n(Jive them all the law will stand, for each\nand every offense, and don\'t limit it to a fine\nwhich can be paid out of the profits, but give\nt hem a salutary dose of imprisonment.\nWe look to the courts for effective aid in\nenforcing this very important law.\nTHE AXTISAU)() LEAGUE AGA1X\nWe note with satisfaction that the Anti\nSaloon League has come to life again, with\nfresh vitality and vigor, and will leave no stone\nunturned to check the ilagrant violation of the\nl\'rohibition Law.\nThs is the line of success. The law will\nrive opposition to it on the part of lawless and\nunscrupulous interests and a good deal of in\nnot enforce itself. There is a good deal of ac\ndifference on the part of a great many more\nwho don\'t much care whether the law is en\nforced or not. Keally loyal citizens, who be\nlieve that laws are made to be enforced, and\nwho believe further that .litis is a very neces\nsary and salutary law, must make a stand\nagainst these lawless agencies of destruction\nand disgrace.\nOur emphatic approval and our best hopes\nfor elliciency and success go with the Anti\nSaloon League of Hawaii.\nSi-ores of passengers were kept waiting\nfrom three o\'clock to five o\'alock on the wharf\nat Nawiliwili landing Friday morning before\nthe last of the hand baggage was brought\nashore. If the powers that be of the Inter\nIsland Steamship Compny had been present\nthey would have heard numerous uncompli\nmentary remarks concerning themselves and\ntheir service.\nWhen, oh, hen are we going to get a boat\nthat is suited to the demands ,f Kauai\'s travel\ning public. For months past the Kinau has\nbeen overcrowded, both going and coming, with\nfirst cabin passengers, who pay !t.72 for the\ntrip, sleeping on mattresses on deck.\n(ierniany loses no opportunity to demand\nthai her burdens be lightened. First one thing\nand then another is brought forward by her as\na basis for a demand for leniency or considera\ntion upon which to base a claim for the reduc\ntion of her indemnity or evasion of the terms of\nthe treaty. Now she wants a rebate of 21 5.000,\n000 marks from the 7,000.000.000 marks to he\npaid France, as her share of the indemnity,\nfixed by the treaty, on account of improvements\non the French roads made by German prisoners\nof war. It would appear that Germany had\nan idea ihiit she won the war and was dictat\ning terms to the allies.\nMaine is celebrating her 100th Birthday.\nThe festivities began on Monday and are to con\ntinue for a week, in the city of Portland. In\nother towns there will be interesting events\na\'i through the summer. On March l.\'ith, lOL\'O.\nMaine was oilicially set off from Massachusetts\nand became a separate State. Kvery citizen of\nthe grand old State is invited to return to the\nhome of his youth and receive a welcome, such\na. only the down east Yankees know how to\ngive.\nEUh\'OPjJAX JiECOXSTltUCTWX\nEurope has returned to work, while I\'tuted\nStates is talking politics and reveling in pro\nfiteering. The pro ti leers will never be satis\nfied until they have closed their tisls upon the\nvery last dollar of surplus money the late war\nlet loose among the people.\nOver in Europe people are busy, and the\nbusier they become the less time they have to\nthink about bolshevism ; hence, except in dis\ntricts where they are actively engaged in kill\ning each other, that wave of insanity is recced\ning, even in Kussia, and will ultimately die a\nnatural death. France, Italy, Holland, Bel\ngium, Spain, Germany and Czecho slovakia\nhave laid aside war for the labors of Peace,\nand they are making good. They are producing\nabundant crops, and within three nuniths will\nhave driven even the shadows of the wolf from\nthe door.\nItaly has made a remarkable recovery, es\npecially in the l\'iave district, where 5,000\nsquare miles of territory were devastated and\n:50 towns destroyed. Signa Nova, Minister of\nState for the Liberated Provinces, reports that:\n"A house has been built for every one destroy\ned in the rural districts. Many towns have\nbeen re built and the railroads and public utili\nties restored."\nKussia blindly pursues her course, under\nthe whip of the national ring-master Lenine;\nbut the Utopian dream has become a nightmare\nof horror, and the elysian lields pastures of dis\ncontent, and the time is not far distant when\nthere will be an awakening that will put an end\nto the hallucinathui, which is today compelling\nrather than enticing. The iron hand of Lenine\nand the work of his proselyting emissaries are\nalone spreading bolshevism among iguorunt\npeople, while those sections of Kussia, where\nthe ruin has been greatest, and where the re\nsources have been exhausted, are awakening\nto their folly, and would get out from under\nthe yoke of the despotic dictator at the first\nopportunity.\nThe\' Czar of Kussia was a despot, who\nnever reached his people to realize their true\ncondition. His mind was cramped and warped\nby his autocratic courtiers, his wife and favor\nites, and prejudiced by designing public ser\nvants, who amassed wealth through criminal\npractices that awakened the minds of the op\npressed people to a hatred for the royal aris\ntocracy, that lived in luxury at the expense of\nthe ignorant and improverished people.\nThe Kussian government was bureaucratic,\nimpenetrable to the common people, and\nfraught with a system of extortion that made\nthe lives of the Kussian people miserable; but\ntheir misery, under the rule of the Czar, never\nreached the desperate character of the present\ncondition, and the people, though ignorant,\npossess suflicieut intelligence to understand\nthat the communist government, as administer\ned by Lenine and Trotsky, is anything but the\nbeautiful dream that it was represented to be.\nEven Emma Goldman writes to her friends\nin America that she is "homesick" and disgust\ned with the whole Kussian problem.\nPoland, which for more than 100 years\nbowed in submission to her opressors, is a com\ning power, although she is now engaged in a\nsenseless and bloody war with the bolshevists\nof Kussia. Her people are industrious, patrio\ntic and thrifty, and will yet discharge their\nobligations to the world with credit to them\nselves and honor to the nations that have been\ninstrumental in gaining their freedom and in\nguaranteeing its permanency.\nAnother case of destructive and demorali\nzing influences is to be found in the condition\nof Austria and Hungary, and while they will\nhave abundant crops, they are sowing the seeds\nof discord and civil strife.\nJingo Slavia, ami especially that portion of\nit that was formerly Serbia, and which suffer\ned most from the war. is an example of fruga\nlity and thrift. This season\'s crops will put\nthem outside the pale of distress, and start\nthem on the road to national prosperity.\nIn truth, many (tarts of Europe are laying\naside the uniforms and the engines of destruc\ntion to take in hand the implements of peaceful\nindusl rv.\nThe report that 1,000 Turks were killed in\na bombardment of Ismid by British ships lying\nat anchor in ihe harbor, before the town, indi\ncates that the war in the near East is not yet\nover; and the manner in which the Greek\ntroops are wiping up the country in the Smyr\nna district indicates that it may be some time\nyet before peace will be restored. In any\nevent the job should be so thoroughly lone that\nthe Turks will he smislied thai further resis\ntance will be fuiile. and that her policy of mur\nder, outrage and brutality must cease.\nBank of Kauai\nOffers New Service\nBy arrangements with Its brokers,\nWilliamson and Buttolph ot Honolulu,\nthe new Dank of Kauai will be furnish\ned with daily utock quotations of the\nHonolulu Stock and Bond Exchange.\nThis is one of the new public service j\nfeatures ot the new institution and is \'\navailable to everyone interested on\nthe Island.\nFor the prenetit these quotations\ncan ho had by calling the bank office\nat Kapaa but later arrangements will\nbe made to have stock sheets posted\nat different centers around the island.

Present were\nthe officers and two representatives\neach from Makaweli, Lihue, Makee and\nMcBryde.\nMr. Sanborn showed that under Arti\ncle 7, Section 1, of the By-Laws, a\nplayer could ask for a release prior to\nopening of season. McBryde\'s claim\nthat a player having signed two lists\nwas barred from playing with either\nteam, was a section in the 1910 by\nlaws, while ihe 1912 gave the other\nversion, allowing a player to change\nfrom cue team to another before the\ni)\'cning of the season.\nOil vote it was decided that Mc\nBryde\'s protest v. as not well taken\nand same was taMed.\nMr. Sanborn offered an amendment\nto the bylwas, allowing new players\nto sign on after the season was begun,\nt\'nder Article 7, Section 2, Paragraph\n(c) no teiim was allowed to add or sub\nstitute the names of additional players\nafter the season was started. Thq\nnew amendment now makes this possi\nble and reads: "Any team shall have\nthe right to add any name or names\nto their players\' list, if less than 31\nnames have been submitted, at an\ntime after filing said list with the\nsecretary, provided saiil name or\nnames be filed with the secretary two\nweeks before said player or player\nparticipate in any game, and provided\nfurther said player or players are boni\nfide residents of and working on\nKauai."\nAppoint Official Umps\nThe league also decided on the fol\nlowing men as official umpires:\nMessrs.

Warner Addresses\nStudent Teachers at\nTerritorial Summer School\nHONOLULU, July 14 Jay O. War\nner, executive secretary of the Young\nMen\'s Christian association on the Is\nland of Kauai, addressed the student\nteachers of the Territorial Summer\nschool this morning at McKinley High\nschool on "Orgnlzatlon of Rural Com\nmunltles."\n"In the meaning of the word as we\nknow It In other parts of the world\nthere is no such thing as community\nlife In Hawaii," he said. We have\nhero what might be termed organized\nIndustrial life, with the American doll\nlar as the common denominator, but\ncommunity life is something that is\nnot, but also something for which we\nare striving. Our people, coming from\nall parts of the globe, and the children\nprincipally born of alien parents, are\nlike a lot of specimens in a bag. It is\nIn the hope of bringing all together\nIn a community spirit, with common\nIdeas, customs and ideals, that the\nY. M. C. A. is supplementing the work\nof the church and the public school in\nHawaii."\nWarner dwelt at some length on\nthe persistant adherence to their na\ntive customs 9f those who have come\nhere from foreign lands, and he men\ntioned the luau of the Hawaiians, not\nforeign, he said", but not conducive to\nthe acquisition of American manners.\n"Tell me what" you eat and I\'ll tell\nyou what you are is not barren of\nmeaning here." he said. "Around the\ntablewe learn much of our ways and\nour customs. It was said of the Jews\nthat when two or more sat down to\neat together they henceforth were\nfriends. To a large extent that is so\nwith us. I believe that community\nbanquets, served with white table\ncloths and American style, with a\nprogrm of music and appropriate\nspeeches at the close, will be a great\nstep ahead in our Americanism work."\nWarner went on to explain the work\nof the Y. M. C. A. in community work\non the island of Kauai, telling of the\nsuccess that had so far been acquired\nalong this line.\nIn the early part of this afternoon\na large group of teachers visited the\nUnited States agricultural experiment\nstation in Makiki and at 4 o\'clock they\nwill make an industrial tour through\nthe Hawaiian Trust Company\'s insti\ntution. Tomorrow morning Miss Alice Judd\nwill address the assembly on "The\nwork of the Girl Scouts."\n:0:\nFrance Honors\nWorkof Dr. Judd\nFrance today rewarded Dr. James\nRobert Judd of Honolulu for ser\nvces rendered that nation during the\nworld war, says the Star-Bulletin of\nthe 14th.\nIn the presence of Governor Charles\n.1.

Yet such is the\ncase.\nThe excess profits tax eats so deep\'\nily Into the profits of successful cor\nporations that every possible avenue\nof escape is sought after with the ut\nmost avidity. At first the most na-\nItural avenue of escape was that of\nInvesting the profits in permanent im\nprovements or extensions of the busl-\nness.\n\' But such betterments were ruled to\n\'be of the nature of profits and subject\nto the tax. Another avenue was that\nlof paying the profits out in increased\nwages, which had the advantage of\n\'defeating the government, but at the\ncost of the corporation. It was a enso\nof cutting off your nose to spite your\nface.\nThe only solution of the dilemma Is\none which will permit the corporation\nto keep its cake and yet appear to cat\nIt. Advertising holds out this two\' fold\n(possibility.\nAdvertising presumably pays it is\nibalt to catch fish. For every dollar\nyou put out you expect to get more\n\'than a dollar back; and advertising\nls a legitimate business expense. By\nmeans of a big advertising Investment\nyou can ovade the tax, and at the\nsame time increase your business. Of\ncourse that may mean that youl will\nhave a bigger income- and a larger ex-\ncess profits tax, but that Is some (lis\nItauce off, and conditions may change\nland the income tax be reduced, etc\nAnyway, whether sound reasoning or\ninot, that is the way it works, and the\nnewspapers in the large centers, are\nfairly swamped with advertising. The\nSaturday Evening Post is an instruc\nthe example of what Is true more or\nless, of all journals everywhere, even\nlour own local papers here on the Is\nlauds. Before the excess profits tax\n\'es were instituted the Saturday Even\ning Post carried less than two nun\ndrod columns of advertising. This\nmagazine now carries over four hun\ndred and fifty columns. That means\ndouble, or more than double tho con\nsumption of paper, and with these big\njournals of an enormous circulation it\nmeans an enormous demand for paper.\nThis means of course a great advance\nin price; but this does not seem to\nlimit the demand which still remains\ninsatiable, and tho sources of supply\nFOR THE HAIR\nPossesses all tho Ingred\nients for tho idaal sham\npoo.
