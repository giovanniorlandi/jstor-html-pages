We frankly ad\nmit we were agreeably surprised to\ndiscover that a Kiwanian was W a\ngoggle-eyed inhabitant of Mars, or, a\nfreak of some kind. A more thor\nough representative, branny, hand\nsome set of men never visited Paris,\nand their visit will be remembered\nfor a many a day.\nThe Windsor Hotel furnished the\nsetting for the visit of the Club,\nwhich held their regular weekly\nmeeting here. The purpose of their\nvisit was to explain the aims and ob\njects of the organization, and to lay\nthe groundwork for a similar orga\nnization in this city. One of the main\nobjects of the Kiwanis Club is to cul\ntivate a closer bond of union and\ngood fellowship among the business\nmen of a town, and great stress was\nlaid on this feature, in the addresses\nmade at the luncheon.\nA delicious luncheon was served in\nthe dining rooms of the Hotel Wind\nsor, during which addresses were\nmade a number of Lexington Kiwan\nians and Paris business men. Mr. C.\nM. Marshall, president of the Club,\npresided, and after a brief talk, in\ntroduced John Skain, who took\ncharge of the meeting. Music was\nfurnished by the Kiwanis Club Quar\ntette, who sang Club songs, such as\n"Mary Jane," "Old Kentucky Home,"\netc. John Milward told a group of\nhumorous stories, and Prof. Edward\nSaxton, of the University of Ken\ntucky, well-known in Paris, read ex\ntracts from his \'play, "The Spirit of\nKiwanis." Short and interesting\ntalks were delivered by Dr. J. A.\nStucky, J. W. Morrison and Judge Q-.\nAllison\' Holland, of Lexington, re\nsponse being made by Emmett M.\nDickson, of Paris. Good cheer and a\nspirit of camaradrie prevailed\nthroughout the meeting, which wa3,\nin all its essentials, a feast of reason\nand flow of soul, literally speaking.\nThe Kiwanis Club members left the\nimpression of being high-toned, in\ntelligent, up-to-date business men,\nand their visit was much appreci\nated. Among the Paris business men\npresent weite: Judge Denis Dundon,\nBuckner Wjoodford, Will G. McClin\ntock, S. S. Ardery, Jr., Wallace W.\nMitchell, William Shire, Jolin P. Da\nvin, W. V.

Bingham, of Louisville,\npresented the claims of burley to\ntobacco growers of Kentucky for\nfinancial relief to the War Fmanro\nCorporation at Washington, Wednes\nday, according to a special dispatch\nto the Louisville Post. Senator\nStanley accompanied the delegation.\nWhile the work of pledging to\nbacco under the contract of the Bur\nley Tobacco Growers\' Co-operative\nAssociation in Kentucky will go on\neven in those counties which have\nraised their quota of seventy-five per\ncent. Organization Manager Joseph\nPassonneau said work in organizing\nthe burley counties of Ohio and Indi\nana will start this week.\nThe forty-one counties in the Buv\nely belt in Kentucky furnished the\nlargest part of the Burley crop,\nwhich normally is about 300,000,000\npounds a year, but which this year\nis not expected to exceed 200,000,000\npounds because of drouth conditions\nBOOTLEGGEEY CASES IN THE\nCOUNTY COUET\nIn the County Court before Judge\nBajterton, L. T. Leach, of Paris, was\nheld to the grand jury in the sum of\n$500 on a charge of having liquor in\nhis possession for the purpose of sale.\nLeach was placed under arrest fol-\nllow a raid at the flat on Main street\noccupied by Mrs. Pennington, where\nmoonshine whisky was found in bot\ntles and jars, besides a lot of empties.\nIt developed from the evidence of\nMrs. Pennington\'s daughter that\nLeach, in company with herself and\nanother young girl, had made two\ntrips by automobile to Berea, each\ntime returning with, moonshine,\nwhich he placed in bottles in her\nmother\'s rooms. The child also tes\ntified that Leach had taken her and\nthe other girl to Winchester and plac\ned them on a train, telling her that\nif she did not leave she would be\nsent to the Reform School. The\nchild\'s father brought her back from\nVirginia. At the conclusion of the\ntrial County Attorney D. D. Cline\nIssued a warrant against Leach,\ncharging him with attempting to ob\nstruct justice by removing important\nwitnesses from the jurisdiction of the\nCourt. He was held under $250\nbond to appear for trial Monday on\nthis charge.\nHerbert King, who was arrested\nat the same time on the same charge,\nwas, on motion of County Attorney\nCline, dismissed on account of in\nsufficient evidence.\nOn Tuesday Judge Batterton held\nwhat might have been termed "pro\ngressive court." Sheriff Will G. Mc\nClintock, with Deputies James Gib\nson, Robt. M. Gilkey and Thos. Mc-\nClintock, attended a game of base\nball at North Middletown, Sunday af\nternoon between two colored nines,\nand placed under arrest John McKee\nJohnson, on a charge of unlawfully\nhaving liquor in his possession. They\nalso summoned a number of negroes\nas witnesses. During the progress\nof the trial Johnson implicated a ne\ngro named Bob Hillman, who was\narrested in the court room. He in\nturn implicated Sam McClure, who\nwas also arrested. Each was held to\n\'the grand jury in the sum of $300.\nJohnson, McClure and Hillman were\nalso implicated, having taken part in\na game of craps on the farm of W.\nA. Thomason, near North Middle\ntown. The officers also arrested Thomas\nStegall, white, charged with having\nunlawfully in his possession whisky\nfor purpose of sale. Steagall was\nfound with four pints of whisky, an\nempty half-gallon jug, and twenty\nquart and half-gallon jars, that con\ntained moonshine whisky. Steagall\nwas held to the grand jury in the\nsum of $500. Albert White, colored,\ncharged with crap shooting, entered\na plea of guilty, and was fined $20\nand costs. John Cain, charged with\nselling whisky, his second offense,\nentered plea of not guilty, and was\nheld to the grand jury in the sum cf\n500.\nSASE BALL NOTES\nThe game at the Second street park\nTuesday afternoon between the Meth\nodist and Christian church teams of\nthe Church League resulted in vic\ntory for the former by the narrow\nmargin of one run. The game was\nfull of thrills and exciting plays,\nwhich were warmly applauded by\nthe large crowd of spectators. In\nthe first inning the Methodists put\nthree runs across the rubber, their\nopponents making one each in the\nthird and sixth innings. The score\nstood this way to the conclusion of,\ntne game. Features of the game\nwere the playing of Soper, Insko and\nOwens for the Methodists, and Smith,\nDay and Miller for the Christians.\nThe Moorefield Pioneers, a classy\namateur team from Nicholas county,\nwill try conclusions with the Paris\nRuggles team at the Second street\npark to-morrow (Saturday) after\nnoon. The Moorefield team is said\nto be one of the best amateur teams\nin Central Kentucky, and the Rug\ngles boys will have their work cut\nout for them if they take the Nicho\nlasites. On Sunday afternoon the\nRuggles team will meet the crack\nCynthiana team at the Second street\npark, at which time it is hoped the\nlocal fans will have the pleasure .!\nseeing them take the taw of the\nMaiden City boys. The teams have\nmet on other occasions, and the\nspectators were given "something to\nthink about."\nLEG BEOKEN WHILE PLAYING\nPENALTY WILL SOON GO ON\nLIST YOUE PEOPEETY NOWl\nPOE TAXATION.

James D. McClintock, Samuel Clay,\nCatesby Spears, Charles Spears and\nHiram Roseberry, members of the\nj Bourbon County Game .and Fish\nClub, were in Lexington, Tuesday\nflight, where they attended a meeting\nJ)f Fayette county sportsmen. The\nmeeting was called for the purpose\nof effecting an organization along\nthe lines of the Bourbon county club,\n.&nd to arouse a sentiment for a more\n\'.faithful and rigid observance of the\ngame laws, particularly the regula\ntions governing the amount of game\nvthat can be legally killed. The Bour\ndon county men gave the Fayette\nmen the benefit of their experiences,\nland the meeting finally resolved it\njself into an airtight agreement be\ntween the representatives of the twox\n(counties to do all in their power to\nhelp each other keep fear of the law\nbefore violators. The Fayette repre\nsentatives were furnished with a\ncopy of the constitution and by-laws\nadopted by the Bourbon county or\nganization. The Paris men were\ncongratulated on the success of their\nventure.\no\nPOLICE COURT BUSY\nTHE LEADER\'S PALL OPEMNG\nUNQUALIFIED SUCCESS\nFor the second time in its history\nsince making Paris an abiding place,\nThe Leader Store held an opening,\nthe Fall Opening being heralded\nyesterday as one of the most auspi\ncious events in the history of this\nstore.

It was more like\na social reception than a business\nproposition.\nThe Fall opening of this remark\nable institution was a success beyond\nall expectations. New fall models Df\nready-to-wear dresses, millinery,\nFrench pattern hats, bright tones and\nshading novelties that appealed to\nthe refined tastes of all the ladies,\nmade a brilliant showing. The sell\ning in the ready-to-wear department\nwas increased one hundred per cent.\nJudging from the sales made at The\nLeader Store yesterday the trade for\nthis fall indicates a return to old-time\ntrade, and that the people are ready\nand walling to spend their money if\nthey find what they want. The Leader\nis going to furnish the ladies of the\ncity and county with this part.\nIn a statement to THE NEWS man\nthe management said: "The Leader\nwill be everything that the people of\nParis desire and we will assist the\nladies to the best of our ability to ex\npress individuality in clothes, both\nin our ready-to-wear and furnishing\ndepartments."

Indeed, it is true\nthat it it had not been for Greece\nthe world might have remained in\ndarkness.\nFor this reason we of to-day must\nsympathize with Greece in what, let\nus hope, is her last struggle again.it\ntyrrany and oppression.\nfif\nI \'Mill I\nTHE studious care\nsriven bv us in\nM following our clients\'\ninstructions is certain\n) to result in arrange-\n- ments in harmony\nwith the desires of\nthose who employ us.\n0\nWMUtiiflflMM\nM .l-iwl--M\n.\nSTOCK, CROP, ETC.\nRecords of one 800-acre farm in\nOhio show an annual increase of ,\n000 bushels of corn through the adop\ntion of new strains of corn and im\nproved methods developed and rec\nommended by the United States De\npartment of Agriculture. The farmer\nhas been following the advice of the\ndepartment for 20 years, and has\nkept careful records of his yield. For\nthe last 10 years the increase aver\nages more than 10 bushels an acre\nover previous years. Beyond the ex\ntra cost of harvesting, the labor and\nexpense is no greater than previously\nso the 8.Q00 bushels is regarded as\nclear gain.\n"Open air housing" of machinery\ncosts Kentucky farmers approximate\nly $3,080,366 a year, according to\nestimates made by J. B. Kelley, head\nof the farm engineering section of\nthe College of Agriculture. This\namount which was estimated from\ncensus reports and experiments con\nducted to determine the respective\nlife-time of properly and improperly\nhoused farming implements is a fair\nrepresentation of the annual loss\nsuffered by farmers of the State by\nleaving machinery in the fields and\nunder trees. According to the 1920\ncensus there is more than $48,354,\n857 worth of machinery on Kentucky\nfarms, the average life of each piece\nof which is 15 to 20 years under\nproper housing conditions. When\nleft exposed to the weather farm\ntools last only one-half as long, ac\ncording to the results of experiments\nwhich show that a properly housed\nform tool lasts 15 years, while an\nunproperly housed one lasts but a lit\ntle more than seven and one-half\nyears, un tnis Dasis iaiiure iu uouse\ntheir machinery causes farmers of the\nState a loss of $6,304,022 a year,\nwhereas the depreciation on machin\nery which is protected from the\nweather while idle is only $2,223,\n\'657. Despite the heavy losses caused\nby leaving machinery exposed to\nweather conditions many farmers still\nfail to give it the proper protection\nafter the season\'s work has been fin\nished, Mr. Kelley said. Many farm\nimplements are left in the fence cor\nnel s, under trees or in the fields\nwhere they were last used with the\nresult that rust and the action of\nthe different weather conditions con\ntribute toward heavy damage. To\nprevent this loss, all machinery\nshould be stored in a suitable house\nas soon as the season\'s work is done,\ncare being taken in putting the im\nplements and tools away that all\nparts are thoroughly cleaned and the\no\nIFWUiLHie\nWhat a Heap of Happiness it Would\nBring to Paris Homes\nHard to do housework with an ach\ning back.\nBrings you hours of misery at leis\nure or at work.\nIf women only knew the cause\nthat\nBackache pains often come from\nweak kidneys,\n\'Twould save much needlsss woe.\nDoan\'s Kidney Pills are for weak\nKidney Pills."\nRead what a Paris citizen says:\nMrs. J.
