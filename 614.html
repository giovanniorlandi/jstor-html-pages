Do\ntry to make something of these young\nonea that you will find floating about.\nIt will be good practice for you In the\nmost important duty that falls to\nwomen. Don\'t compete with them In\ntheir employments unless you have\nto. AH the college presidents wall\nover the young men because they\ncan\'t get enough of them Interested In\nknowledge. If you have some knowl\nedge, feed out a little to them, sugar\ncoated, and if they have any. get It\nout of them.

Material things im\nmensely abound, mems can be got for\nanything that deserves the, but the\nfire that touches the spirits of men Is\nsomewhat to seek. Money\'s a-plenty;\nbricks, stone, food, books, end all that,\nbut Inspiration Is scarce. Have It to\ngive if you can. E. 8.
