XXXI.\nBOONE WATAUGA COUNTY, N. C, THURSDAY MAY 13, 1920.\nNO 30.\n1\nffl\nlllsslonari to China Writes\nDear Brethern and Sisters:\nAgain I wish to say just a per\nsonal word to you," Alexander\nBrier Creek and a few other\nchurches in North Carolina.\nArrangements have been made\ndefinitely, for the sailing of our\nparty of eight next August. We\nwill D. V. be leaving North Caro\nlina soon after the middle of Au\ngust and are to sail on the S. S.\nNile from San Francisco August\n23th.\nPassage money for these out\ngoing Missionuries is gradually\ncoming in and we are looking to\nGod to supply all needed by the\ntime we leave North Carolina,\nwhich will be soon after the 15th\nof August.\nNow I have not laid aside any\nthing for my passage money and\nam not planning to get any from\nother sources, but want to look\nYOU and YOU alone to sup\nply me, and I believe with all my\nheart you wjll do it cheerfully,\nand I am writing this merely to\ncall attention to the matter and\nlet you know when to send in\nyour offerings. It will be best\nto send in a contribution from\nech church and individual who\nwants to help in this, immediate\nly after you receive this letter\naid then one about the first of\nAugust. If you do this I am\nsure there will be all I need on\nhand when I get ready to start\nin August. I want this to be a\nfree-will offering as a matter of\nbounty cheerfully as unto the\nLord, for in this way, alone, will\nit become a real ble ssing to you\nas well as me.-\nGod has wonderfully blessed\nour China Direct Mission work\nin calling others to go out with\nus. One man has been called\nfrom your midst, Brother John\nA. Abernathy, and if you feel led\nto help him I know the Lord\nwould be pleased in your having\na part in his passage also, but we\nare helping that Wiseman associa\ntion in Tennessee will furnish\npissage money for him and sup\nport him too.\nWhile we are thankful for what\nGol has done and for th\'e pros\npects, we are also constantly re\nminded of our own weakness and\nthe need of prayer. So let us al\nke jp our eyes on Him who is our\nonly hope.\nSoon there will be the sad fare\nwells again and it is never easy,\nfor oh how precious are loved\nones and you all; and because of\nour fellowship in labor, sorrow\nand suffering for so long you now\nseem doubly dear to me, but for\nHis sake I with joy turn my face\nmy face to China again, and what\never else happens don\'t forget to\npray for me and for all of us that\nwhether it be through suffering\nand sorrow or joy and prosperity\nwe may be fruitful in leading\nmany to Christ.\nYour fellow laborer in Christ,\nT. L. BLALOCK\nLadger, N. C.\nP. S. Our date of sailing has\nbeen moved up a week, to the\n2lst of Auflrust. There are 9 in\nour party who are planning defi\nnitely to go with us.

All will not be atauy\none Institute, but they and some\nNext Years Schools.\nNew and Observer.\nThe public schools are closing\nfor the season. Now that they\nare winding up this season it is\ntime to face the fact that next\nyear the schools should be made\nbetter, for far too many of them\nhave fallen short of what they\nmight be. It is useless to try to\ndodge the fact that in North Car\nolina as in every other state the\nchildren are not getting what is\ndue them. It is not a matter of\nmoney but of indifference. We\nhave money enough to buy gaso-\nine and silk shirts and other\nthings that take millions. We\neave money to buy things we nev\ner thought before of buying, and\nwe have an abundance of money\nto make our schools a hundred\nper cent better than they are. If\nwe do not make the improvement\nit is purely a matter of indiffer\nence, or what is worse, absolute\nopposition.\nThe main thing the child gets\nout of life is a chance to live the\nbroadest possible existence when\nchildhood is ended and manhood\nbegins. Not to teach a child to\nread and write and cipher is a\ncrime, not to advance it iartner\nthan that is an inexcusable neg\nlect. Not to help it as far along\nin education as it can go is an of\nfense that should never be com\nmitted. The childs welfare de\nmands the most of education that\ncan ne given it, ana wnen tne\nwelfare of the child is provided\nthe welfare of the State follows.\nWhat does a crop of cotton or\ntobacco signify as compared with\na crop of boys and girls? Yet we\npour out money lavishly to get\nthe best crops we know how if it\nis field crops, and we dodge the\nexpense if it is crop of boys and\ngirls we undertake to raise. Fair\nness tothechildren wouldprompt\nthat we make the financing of the\nschools follow one question, how\nmuch does it need, and then pro\nceed at once to provide that much,\nWe are not a poverty -burdened\nState. We can care for our own.\nWe can certainly afford education\nfor the child if we can afford a\nhundred and ten thousand auto\nmobiles.\nIt is not poverty that makes\nNorth Carolina schools less effi\ncient than they should be. It is\nplain indifference. We are con\ntent to let them go as they are\nOtherwise we would make them\ndifferent. That three million\npeople of us cannot pay a few\nmillion dollars for schools is ri\ndiculous.\nWatauga\'s Jurors for Federal Court.\nFollowing is a listof Watauga\'s\nquota of jurors for the next term\nof the Federal Court, who are\nsummoned to appear in Wilkes\nboro on Tuesday morning, May\n25, 15)20:\nJohn M.

Mc\nKelvey, Newark, Delaware.\n1-4 lOt. c.\nThe Road Building Problem.\nStatesville Landmark.\nThe Federal bureau of public\noads has advised the North Car\nina State highway commission\nto curtail as far as possible the\netting of contracts for new road\nconstruction and to accept no\nbids that are unreasonable until\nconditions return to normal and\nroad building material becomes\navailable in larger quantities.\nThe Raleigh News and Obser\nver states that recent projects\nadvertised by the State commiss\nion have been without bids of any\nnature, and in one or two cases\nlie counties in which the pro\njects are located, the county has\nobligated to build the road for the\ncommission. Bids advertised for\netting last week on three impor\ntant projects brought no offer.\nhe causeway over the Bruns\nwick river in Brunswick county\nacross from Wilmington, adver\ntised for last week, received no\nattention from contractors, al\nthough it is one of the most at\ntractive propositions offered by\nthe commission.\nThe letter to the commission\nfrom the federal bureau is as fol-\nows:\n"In view of the difficulty many\nof the states are experiencing in\netting road contracts at reason\nable prices, and in1 order that in\nyour conference with State high\nway officials you may be better\nable to indicate our position to\nthem, it has been thought advisa\nble to set forth some of the prin\nciples it is believed should govern\nus under the present conditions\nin proceeding with road building\ninvolving Federal aid funds.\nThere seems no definite indi\ncation at present of any marked\nrecession in the prices at which\nroad work may be done. \' The\ncost of livinir since the summer\nof 1915 has steadily increased un\ntil it is now double the cost at\nthat time and it is still increasing\nslowlv. This is a result of i the\navy demand upon the labor sup\nply of the country for which the\nexceedingly active business of\nroad building is partially respon\nsible.\nIt, therefore, appears to this\nbureau that widespread attempts\nto force through a too expensive\nprogram of road building will\ncontribute very materially tofur\nther increases in costs and that\nwe should take a conservative\nview on the letting of new con\ntracts.\nIt is thought that the pro\ngram must do uetermineu ior\nthe individual States or groups\nof States if the individual pro\ngrams conflict.\n"We believe care should betak\nen in awarding new contracts so\nthat the completion of existing\ncontracts may not be endangered\nand States which have a largo\namount of uncompleted contract\nwork should proceed very cau\ntiouslv in awarding new con\ntracts.\n"It appears desirable that\ncareful survey should be made\nin each State to determine the\npossible amount of road work\nthat can be completed during the\nyear and that only in very excep\ntional cases should contracts le\nawarded at this time which\nit\nseems probable may not be com\npleted during the year.\n\'"Where more than one State is\ndependent upon the same sou re\nes of supply for materials,\nseems advisable that there should\nbe an agreement between the\nstates as to the division of such\nmaterials.\nThe wide variations in some\nof the estimates oi cost received\nindicate the necessity for a clear\ner understanding of the condi\ntion upon which they are based\nThe Girl on Indian Penny,\n, In 1835 the United States gov\nernment offered a prize of $1,000\nfor the best design to put on the\nnew one-cent coin which was\ns Mn to be circulated. It happen\ned that at the time the offer was\nmade, some Indian chiefs from\nthe Northwest went toWashing\nton to see the "Great Father,"\nas they called the President, and\nfrom there they journeyed to\nPhiladelphia to see the mint.\nJames Barton Longacre, chief\nengraver, invited the Indians to\nhis house, where Sarah, his 10\nyear old girl, was very much in\nterested in the strange guests.\nOne of the chiefs, to amuse Sa\nrah, took off his gorgeous war\nbonnet and placed it on her head.\nAn artist who was prosentquick-\nsketched the child and passed\nthe picture to her father. It oc\ncurred to Mr. Longacre that the\nkeness might well compete for\nle prize offered for the new coin.\nHe sent it in. The officials aceep-\n3d it, and for nearly a century\nSarah\'s picture, stamped on pen\nnies found its way to every part\nof the country.
