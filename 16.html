Based on the characteristics of emergency materials\ndispatch, DVRP changed the EMD into a series of static problems in time axis. Amathematical multiobjective model is established,\nand the corresponding improved ant colony optimization algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Finally, a numeric example\nis provided to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of this proposed model and algorithm.\n1. Introduction\nIn the emergency situations, such as earthquakes, snowstorms,\nand wars, ensuring all kinds of materials to be\nefficiently dispatched is the key problem to the emergency\nlogistics. And it is also a typical dynamic vehicle routing\nproblem whose aim is exactly a guarantee of the smooth\nlogistic workflow process. Meanwhile, emergency material\ndispatch problem is a much more complex vehicle routing\nproblem because of its high efficiency and strict time limitation.Therefore,\nexploring themodelingmethods and efficient\nsolving algorithms under the dynamic condition is greatly\nsignificant [1].\nThe research scope of dynamic vehicle routing problem\n(DVRP) includes uncertain demands, uncertain network\nperformance, uncertain service vehicles, and subjective preference\nof decisionmakers.The solving strategy can be divided\ninto two categories. One is local optimization strategy, which\ndeals with the dynamic adjustment of implementation process\nand local optimization algorithms.The insertionmethod\nand k-opt method are often used to redesign the routing\nlines and vehicles distribution [2]. The other one is restarting\noptimization strategy, which is actually a static solution\nfor dynamic problems. Once received determined real-time\ninformation, the strategy starts from the very beginning\nagain to find the optimal material dispatch scheme. As one\nsuccessful application of restarting optimization strategy,\nParaftis used dynamic programming (DP) to deal with dial-aride\nproblems with one vehicle [3]. However, this method can\nonly solve small-scale problems not exceeding ten demand\nnodes.\nAnt colony algorithm (ACA) has the nature advantage\nto adapt the dynamic environment with inherent robustness.\nEyckelhof [4] carried out some research of VRP under the\ncondition of unchanging node number and changing node\ndistance, which indicates the sudden change of traffic congestion\ndegree. The preliminary study results show that the\noriginal version and some slightly improved versions of ACA\nare quite good in solving some simple test performances.\nWang [5] changed the dynamic vehicle routing problem into\na series of static subproblems based on time axis. The path\npheromone is reinitialized and the new problem with old\nunmet demand nodes and new nodes in next dispatch round\nis modeled to be solved.\nBecause emergency logistics is focusing on speed instead\nof quantity, the dynamic effective material management is\nto replace the inventory materials’ lack of mobility. The key\npoint of emergency material dispatch in this paper is how to\nensure the reliability of material supply stability in dynamic\nenvironment. Based on the characteristics of emergency\nmaterial dispatch problem, the multiobjective mathematic\nmodel is established, an improvedACAoptimization strategy\n', '2 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\nand algorithm are developed, and a numeric example proved\nthis method is feasible to generate real-time emergency\nmaterial dispatch scheme corresponding to each point of the\ntime axis.\n2. Mathematic Model of Emergency Material\nDispatch in Dynamic Environment\nAs to dynamic events of DVRP, the normal treatments are\nthe event trigger mechanism and rolling horizon principle.\nWhile we adopt the event triggermechanism, the new arrived\nmaterial assignment is immediately inserted into the running\ndispatch scheme. Meanwhile we adopt the rolling horizon\nprinciple and divide the operation time into several small\nhorizons. In the intervals, the material dispatch scheme is\nadjusted. The two treatments have both advantages and disadvantages.\nThe former one may cause the frequent scheme\naltering, while the latter one may decrease the service quality.\n2.1. Strategic Analysis. Because sudden incidents in the emergency\nlogistics are various and discrete, the demand of\nmaterials is changing with the development of the situation.\nAccording to the actual material assignment operation, a\nrolling horizon multitask decision-making emergency material\ndispatch model is built based on time axis, and the\ndispatch scheme is updatedwhile distributing unfinished dispatch\nscheme and addon dispatch scheme in these intervals.\nIn the interval, the event occurrences trigger the simple\n𝐾 exchange neighborhood optimization and service denial\nstrategy, while guaranteeing that every undamaged vehicle\nfinally returns to the logistic center. Based on the instant\nstatistics information about each node demands of the\nmoment, the dynamic model can be converted to submodels.\nAs the time goes on, thematerial demands of customer nodes\nwill accumulate because of the frequent scheme altering or\nthe assignment finishing rate as shown in Figure 1.\nThe restart strategy based on rolling horizon principle\nhas three advantages. Firstly, the dispatch scheme can change\nwith the dynamic network attributes. Because the material\nflow is continuous, the new dispatch scheme round can\nbe adjusted to take full use of limited transport network\nresources. Secondly, it can reduce the complexity of problem\nand generate simpler and easier schemes, inwhich every vehicle\nstarts from the logistic center and the initial capacity is the\nloading capacity. Thirdly, the improved ACA algorithm can\nspeed up response time by using the information generated\nfrom the solving process of former dispatch scheme.\n2.2. Variable Parameter Descriptions. The vehicles that have\nbeen the starting must try their abilities to serve all nodes\nand the vehicles which are in the logistic center are dispatched\naccording to actual need. The mathematic model of\nemergency material dispatch is built based on some cases as\nfollows.\n(i) Emergency materials are all generic class material\nand dispatched as standardized container units whose\nunit of measurement is twenty-foot equivalent units\n(TEU).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nAdd-on dispatch scheme\nCustomer nodes\nAc\ncu\nm\nul\nat\ned\n m\nat\ner\nia\nl d\nem\nan\nds\nUnfinished dispatch scheme\nFigure 1: Accumulated material demands of customer nodes.\n(ii) A route can only start from the logistic center and end\nin the logistic center.\n(iii) The type of vehicles is single and the lay time is\nignored. The drive speed is constant and the initial\nroute weight matrix 𝐴 is represented by the distance\nbetween nodes.\n(iv) The emergency materials should be dispatched into\nall customer nodes safely, cheaply, and fast during the\ntransportation.\n(v) The parameters of the mathematic model are all\ninteger decision variables.\nAccording to the current research situation, the problem\nto be studied is described as a vector set of 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐷,𝑊, 𝑅)\nat the moment of 𝑡. The problem is a network topology\n𝑉 = {V\n0\n, V\n1\n, V\n2\n, . . . , V\n𝑛\n} that contains a logistic center and 𝑁\ncustomer nodes (C node for short), where𝑁 is themaximum\nnumber of the𝐶 nodes. Each node has an associated location\n[𝑥\n𝑖\n, 𝑦\n𝑖\n], and the network is in the Euclidean plane, so the\ntravel distance 𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\nbetween any two nodes V\n𝑖\nand V\n𝑗\nis the\nstraightline distance between them.The distance 𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\nbetween\nany two nodes of vector𝑉 constitutes the route weight matrix\n𝐷, which is symmetric and satisfy the triangle inequality:\n𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\n≤ 𝑑\n𝑖𝑙\n+𝑑\n𝑙𝑗\n. And the travel time can be obtained if you divide\nthe distance by the drive speed, which is also a constant. Each\n𝐶 node denotes a service request. All requests will randomly\narrive within a planning fixed horizon. Accumulatedmaterial\ndemands which contain both unfinished dispatch scheme\nand addon dispatch scheme are expressed as vector 𝑊 =\n{𝑤\n1\n, 𝑤\n2\n, 𝑤\n3\n, . . . , 𝑤\n𝑛\n}, which corresponds to the emergency\nmaterial demand of 𝐶 node V\n𝑖\nat the moment of 𝑡. Every\nvehicle must depart from and return to the logistic center,\nand the transportation parameter matrix is 𝑅 = (𝐾,𝑄).\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 3\nThe logistic center has 𝐾 service vehicles whose loading\ncapacity is 𝑄 TEU.\nDefine binary variable:𝑥\n𝑖𝑗𝑘\n= {\n1 if vehicle 𝑘 drives fromnode V\n𝑖\nto node V\n𝑗\n0 else.\n(1)\n2.3. Objective Function\nmin 𝑧\n1\n=\n𝐾\n∑\n𝑘=1\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑗=0\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑖=0\n𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\n𝑥\n𝑖𝑗𝑘\n, (2)\nmin 𝑧\n2\n=\n𝐾\n∑\n𝑘=1\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑗=1\n𝑥\n0𝑗𝑘\n. (3)\nThe model seeks the optimization routes of the current\nsnapshot so that the total dispatch service benefit is maximized.\nEquation (2) is an object function minimizing the\ntotal dispatch route length, which also makes the drive cost\nthe lowest. Equation (3) is an object function minimizing the\nnumber of vehicles that have been put into use in the logistic\ncenter, which also cuts down greatly the fixed charges. And\nthe two targets will guarantee the maximum of emergency\nmaterial dispatch safety.\nIn this paper the multiple objectives are integrated into a\nsingle objective with the weight coefficient method, and the\nweight vector of the two objectives is 𝜔 = (0.354, 0.646),\nwhich was obtained from importance comparison matrix in\nAHP. Considering the data in numeric example, the value of\n𝑧\n1\nranged from 800 to 1000, and the value of 𝑧\n2\nranged from 9\nto 22.Therefore we used weighted summation of the two data\nto get the single objective function 𝑍 as follows:\nmin𝑍 = 0.354 ⋅ lg𝑧\n1\n+ 0.646 ⋅ 𝑧\n2\n. (4)\n2.4. Constraint Conditions. Consider\n𝐾\n∑\n𝑘=1\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑗=1\n𝑥\n0𝑗𝑘\n≤ 𝐾; (5)\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑗=0\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑖=0\n𝑤\n𝑗\n𝑥\n𝑖𝑗𝑘\n≤ 𝑄, 𝑘 ∈ 𝐾, (6)\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑗=1\n𝑥\n0𝑗𝑘\n=\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑖=1\n𝑥\n𝑖0𝑘\n≤ 1, 𝑘 ∈ 𝐾, (7)\n𝐾\n∑\n𝑘=1\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑖=0\n𝑥\n𝑖𝑗𝑘\n= 1; 𝑗 = {1, 2, 3, . . . , 𝑁} , (8)\n𝐾\n∑\n𝑘=1\n𝑁\n∑\n𝑗=0\n𝑥\n𝑖𝑗𝑘\n= 1; 𝑖 = {1, 2, 3 . . . , 𝑁} , (9)\n𝑖 ̸= 𝑗. (10)\nEquation (5) ensures that the total number departed from\nthe logistic center is less than the upper bound in every\ninterval of dispatch scheme. Equation (6) ensures that the\nsum of total demand of all 𝐶 nodes in a vehicle’s route is\nless than its loading capacity. Equation (7) can ensure that\nall vehicles have departed from the logistic center and finally\nreturned to the depot. Equations (8) and (9) ensure that every\n𝐶 node has one and only one predecessor node and successor\nnode and is visited only once by a vehicle. Expression (10)\ncan ensure the travel route of every vehicle forbid loop node,\nespecially looping in the logistic center.\n3. Ant Colony Algorithm Design of DVRP\nDealing with DVRP, the new input information could make\nthe former optimal dispatch scheme change into the suboptimal,\neven the infeasible scheme. In the static environment, it\nis tolerable to spend more processing time for commanders\ngetting high quality or optimal dispatch scheme. However,\ncommanders want to obtain the dispatch scheme immediately;\nthe fewer seconds or minutes are the better in an\nemergency.\nThe main idea of this algorithm design is to improve the\nperformance of basic ant colony algorithm by state transformation\nrules using load rating function and pheromone\nupdate rules based on ant ranking system [6]. Furthermore,\nthe route pheromone information is reserved while solving\nthe former dispatch scheme, so the latter dispatch scheme\nsolving process is speeded up and the emergency material\ndispatch scheme is generated.\n3.1. State Transformation Rules of ACA. Dorigo M put forward\nthe adaptive pseudorandom probability transformation\nrule in ant-Q algorithm in 1993 [6]. In general approach\nof basic Dorigo ant algorithm, each of 𝑚 ants constructs\nseveral routes touring through all the given 𝑁 cities in every\ngeneration, which makes up the dispatch scheme. Starting\nat a random city an ant selects the next city using heuristic\ninformation as well as pheromone information, which serves\nas a form of memory by indicating which choices were good\nin the past. In order to enhance the accuracy and reality of\nthe ants while they choose travel routes, this paper proposes\nthe improved state transformation rule which takes full use\nof load rating in view of constraint expression (6) as follows.\nConsider\n𝑆 = {\nargmax {𝜏𝛼\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) ⋅ 𝜂\n𝛽\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) ⋅ 𝜇\n𝛾\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡)} , if𝑅 ≤ 𝑅\n0\n𝑝\n𝑘\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) , else,\n(11)\n𝑝\n𝑘\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) =\n{{{\n{{{\n{\n𝜏\n𝛼\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) ⋅ 𝜂\n𝛽\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) ⋅ 𝜇\n𝛾\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡)\n∑\n𝑠∈allowed𝑘\n𝜏\n𝛼\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) ⋅ 𝜂\n𝛽\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) ⋅ 𝜇\n𝛾\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡)\n, if 𝑠 ∈ allowed\n𝑘\n0, else.\n(12)\nThe probability for ant 𝑘 to append arc (V\n𝑖\n, V\n𝑗\n) to its partial\nsolution is then given as 𝑝𝑘\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡); 𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\nindicates the pheromone\nconcentration information; 𝜂\n𝑖𝑗\nrepresents the expectation\nheuristic information, which equals the reciprocal of 𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\n', '4 Mathematical Problems in Engineering\nand minimizes the total dispatch route length. 𝜇\n𝑖𝑗\nrepresents\nthe load rating heuristic information, which minimizes\nthe number of vehicles in use. 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝛾 are constants\nthat determine the relative influence corresponding to the\npheromone values, distance values, and load rating values\non the decision of the ant 𝑘. Random variable 𝑅 follows 0-1\nuniform distribution. Parameter 𝑅\n0\n(0 ≤ 𝑅\n0\n≤ 1) determines\nstate transformation rule, which also indicates the relative\nimportance of exploitation versus exploration. The nodes set\nallowed\n𝑘\ncontains the remaining nodes that have not been\nvisited so far by ant 𝑘.\nWhile ant 𝑘 has 𝑄\n𝑖\nTEU capacity at node V\n𝑖\n, and the\nmaterial demand of successor node V\n𝑗\nis 𝑤\n𝑗\nTEU. Function\n𝜇\n𝑖𝑗\n= (\n𝑄\n𝑖\n+ 𝑤\n𝑗\n𝑄\n) , if 𝜇\n𝑖𝑗\n> 1, then 𝜇\n𝑖𝑗\n= 0. (13)\n3.2. Pheromone Update Rules. Once the𝑚 ants of the colony\nhave completed their computation, the better dispatch routes\nare used to globally modify the pheromone trail. In this way\na “preferred route” is memorized in the pheromone trail\nmatrix and future ants will use this information to generate\nnew solutions in a neighborhood of this preferred route. For\npheromone initialization we set 𝜏\n0\n= 1/(𝑁 − 1) for every arc\n(V\n𝑖\n, V\n𝑗\n) at the beginning of each iteration.\nWhen ant 𝑘 moves from V\n𝑖\nto V\n𝑗\n, a local updating\nis performed on the pheromone matrix, according to the\nfollowing rule:\n𝜏\n𝑖𝑗 (𝑡 + 1) = (1 − 𝜌1) ⋅ 𝜏𝑖𝑗 (𝑡) + 𝜌1𝜏0, (14)\nwhere parameter 𝜌\n1\ndetermines the evaporation rate of\npheromone.\nThe global pheromonematrix adapts the elite ant strategy,\nwhich only uses the optimal and suboptimal dispatch route.\nAnd it is updated as follows:\n𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡 + 1) = (1 − 𝜌\n2\n) ⋅ 𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) + 𝜌\n2\nΔ𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) ,\nΔ𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\n(𝑡) =\n{{\n{{\n{\n𝜙\n1\n, if 𝑒\n𝑖𝑗\n∈ optimal dispatch route\n𝜙\n2\n, if 𝑒\n𝑖𝑗\n∈ suboptimal dispatch route\n0, otherwise,\n(15)\nwhere parameter 𝜌\n2\ndetermines the evaporation rate of\npheromone, 𝜙\n1\nand 𝜙\n2\nare constants, and 𝜙\n1\n> 𝜙\n2\n> 0.\n3.3. Dynamic Modification Rules of Pheromone Matrix. During\nthe emergency material dispatch, service requests are\nreceived in real time, and serviceability of requesting node\nis immediately verified. The target of this paper is to get\nthe updated dispatch scheme based on rapid reaction to the\ndynamic information about the traffic capacity of transport\nnetwork and demand nodes. However, the situations of\ndynamic environment can be divided into three types as\nfollows:\n(i) the change in route weight matrix𝐷,\n(ii) the change in material demand of customer nodes,\n(iii) the change in optimization objectives of material\ndispatch.\nHow to modify the pheromone matrix as much as\npossible to adjust the change in route weight matrix is the\nkey point. Among these three situations, types (i) and (ii)\nare more common in connectivity and travel time reliability\nalong with the development of the situation. The simplest\nstrategy is reinitializing all pheromones to 𝜏\n0\nand then\nrestarting the ant algorithmwhile making the solving process\ninefficiency, so the current solving process should make full\nuse of the previous results of the dispatch scheme calculation\nin order to reduce the computation time. For description, the\nmodification rules are as follows.\n(1) Rule 1: Dynamic Distance Weight between Nodes. In\nthe case of the distance between any two nodes V\n𝑖\nand V\n𝑗\nchanging,𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷𝑖𝑠 is themaximumof all the𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\nin the former\nroute weight matrix 𝐷; the pheromone modification rule of\narc (V\n𝑖\n, V\n𝑗\n) is expressed as follows:\nIf (𝑑\n𝑎𝑖\n< 𝑃 × 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷𝑖𝑠) ∨ (𝑑\n𝑏𝑖\n< 𝑃 × 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷𝑖𝑠)\n∨ (𝑑\n𝑎𝑗\n< 𝑃 × 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷𝑖𝑠)\n∨ (𝑑\n𝑏𝑗\n< 𝑃 × 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷𝑖𝑠)\nThen 𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\n= 𝜏\n0\n⋅ (1 + log(\n𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\n𝜏\n0\n)) ,\n(16)\nwhere parameter 𝑃 ∈ [0, 1] determines the adjustment range.\n𝑃 = 0 means no adjustment, while 𝑃 = 1 means all\npheromones are changing according to this rule.\n(2) Rule 2: Dynamic Regulation of Customer Nodes Demands.\nIn the case of the demand 𝑤\n𝑖\nof node V\n𝑖\nchanging, 𝑁 is the\nnumber of all customer nodes; the pheromone modification\nrule of arc (V\n𝑖\n, V\n𝑗\n) is expressed as follows:\n𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\n= (1 − 𝜃\n𝑖\n) ⋅ 𝜏\n𝑖𝑗\n+ 𝜃\n𝑖\n⋅\n1\n𝑁 − 1\n(17)\n(1) 𝜂-strategy [2], as Figure 2. Consider\n𝜃\n𝑖\n= max{0, 1 −\n𝜂\n𝜆 ⋅ 𝜂\n𝑖𝑗\n} ; 𝜆 ∈ [0, +∞) ,\n𝜂 =\n1\n𝑛 ⋅ (𝑛 − 1)\n⋅\n𝑛\n∑\n𝑖=1\n∑\n𝑗=1,𝑗 ̸= 𝑖\n𝜂\n𝑖𝑗\n.\n(18)\nBecause parameter 𝜂\n𝑖𝑗\nequals the reciprocal of𝑑\n𝑖𝑗\n, so it can\nbe inferred that parameter 𝜃\n𝑖\nis inversely proportional to the\ndistance between node V\n𝑖\nand the changed node.\n(2) 𝜏-strategy [2], as shown in Figure 3. Consider\n𝜃\n𝑖\n= min {1, 𝜆 ⋅ 𝜓} ; 𝜆 ∈ [0, +∞) ,\n𝜓 = max\n{\n{\n{\n∏\n(𝑥,𝑦)∈𝑃𝑖𝑘\n𝜏\n𝑥𝑦\n𝜏max\n}\n}\n}\n.\n(19)\n', 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering 5\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nFigure 2: 𝜂-strategy.\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\nFigure 3: 𝜏-strategy.\nFrom the equations it can be deduced that the closer\narc (V\n𝑖\n, V\n𝑗\n) is next to the changed node, the more equalized\npheromone is in the route.\nTo illustrate the 𝜂-strategy and 𝜏-strategy operation, we\nused a 10 × 10 grid of cities and set 𝜆 = 1 to visualize how\nthe distribution of reset values takes place. In Figure 2 the\ndistribution for the 𝜂-strategy is proportionate to Euclidean\ndistance, while Figure 3 shows that the 𝜏-strategy tends to\ndistribute along the path. By comparing the two strategies,\nwe choose 𝜂-strategy to deal with dynamic regulation of\ncustomer nodes demands.\n(3) Rule 3: Dynamic Regulation of Nodes Number. When the\nincreased node number equals the decreased number, replace\nthe nodes and then deal in Rule (1).\n(1) When the increased node number is more than the\ndecreasednumber, directly delete the row and column\nin which the node stays.\n(2) When the increased node number is less than the\ndecreased number, insert the new node, calculate the\ndistance weight, and initialize pheromone to 𝜏\n0\n.\n3.4. Detailed Steps of Improved ACA\nStep 1. Calculate the dispatch scheme at the initial time of 𝑡\n0\nusing improved ACA and generate the solved result.\nStep 2. Overwrite the pheromone matrix into the excel\ndocument “pheromone” until the iteration stops.\nStep 3. When calculating the new dispatch scheme, read the\ndata in excel document “pheromone” and save it initialize\npheromone matrix.\nStep 4. According to the specific changing information of\ndynamic environment, update the pheromone matrix with\nmodification rules in Section 3.2.\nStep 5. Calculate the dispatch scheme at the time of 𝑡 using\nimproved ACA, generate the new solved result, and then go\nto and execute Step 2.\n4. Experimental Results\nTheemergencymaterial dispatch system contains one logistic\ncenter and 100 demand nodes. The loading capacity of each\nvehicle is 200TEU.The static data of numeric example in this\npaper adapts the C101 and R101 from Solomon benchmark\nat the initial moment. As the situation develops, such as\nearthquake, snowstorm, and war, each problem has 5 groups\nof dynamic data which are used to depict 5 different dynamic\ndegrees of 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90%, respectively.\nWe randomly choose the proportional elements of distance\nmatrix𝐷 and nodes demand vector𝑊 from𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐷,𝑊, 𝑅)\nto simulate the dynamic environment. The distance matrix is\nnot symmetric and does not satisfy the triangle inequality any\nmore. The test data set is designed by modifying benchmark\nmethod, which was proposed by Lackner [7] in 2004.\nThe test work is completed on a desktop computer with\nIntel Pentium Dual-Core E5700@3.0GHz, 2046 MB RAM,\nand Windows XP SP3 Professional Operating system. The\nalgorithm is coded and compiled usingM file inMatlab 7.8.0.\nThe simulation experimental results are shown in Table 1.\nFor description convenience, we call the column (1)\nC1, column (2) C2, and so on. C1 represents the data\ntype of Solomon’s 100-customer benchmark problems.\nC2 and C3 are the best known results obtained by\nthe heuristics for Solomon’s static VRPTW problems\nreported in http://www.sintef.no/static/am/opti/projects/top\n/vrp/bknown.html (last updates: March 24, 2005). C4 DoD is\nshort for the degree of dynamism, which means the changing\nnodes’ percentage of all the nodes. Among the data items\nfrom the table, C5, C6, and C7 are the computational results\nfor proposed approach, and they are also the average number\nof used vehicles (NV), the average travel distance (length),\nand the average CPU time (CPU, in s), respectively.The CPU\ntime is the time used for solving each static version problem.\nSo are the C8, C9, and C10.\nOther parameters are set as follows. The ant colony size\nis 50 ants, the number of iterations is 100, and the heuristic\nfactor is g 𝛼 = 1, 𝛽 = 5, 𝛾 = 1.

The state transformation rule parameter\n𝑅\n0\n= 0.6, and the dynamic modification rule parameters\n𝑃 = 0.1, 𝜆 = 2.\nAs shown in Table 1, the basic ACO algorithm with a\nsimple restart strategy uses one more vehicle and generates\nthe suboptimal total dispatch route, while its solution time\nis far more than other algorithms. The improved ACO\nalgorithm with pheromone reserved strategy can meet the\nrequirement of quick decisions, which saves an average of\n50% computation time searching the optimal emergency\nmaterial dispatch scheme. And the total computation time\nis less than 80 seconds in absolute amount dealing with 100node\nproblem. Because of simplifiedmodeling, this improved\nACOalgorithm is superior to the LNS algorithm in [8]. So the\nimprovedACO algorithmdesigned in this paper is optimal in\nthe vehicles number and suboptimal in the total route length.\n5. Conclusions\nThemultiobjective materials dispatch model is built by linear\nweighted method. The dynamic information generated in\nthe process of emergency material dispatch is disposed in\nbatches by rolling horizon strategy, such as traffic capacity of\ntransport network or demand nodes. Eventually, a numeric\nexample is designed in 5 different dynamic degrees to prove\nthe validity of this model and algorithm. The modified\nant colony optimization algorithm utilizes the pheromone\nreserved by old material dispatch scheme to initialize the\nant colony pheromone matrix in seeking for the next new\ndispatch scheme.Thismethod improves the quality of scheme\nsolutions and obviously the solving efficiency, while generating\nmaterial dispatch scheme in real time based on current\nemergencymaterial dispatchnetwork.However, there are still\nsome problems that need to be studied such as split demand,\ncomplete set, and multimodal transport of complex dynamic\nemergency materials dispatch problem.\nReferences\n[1] Y.
