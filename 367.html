The\nSecretary of State for the Home Department (“the Secretary of State”) had\nrefused his application for asylum on the basis that, by his own admission, he\nhad held a position as commander in the Basij, an Iranian paramilitary force\nwhich enforced what it considered to be Islamic values in Iran. The appellant\nbore command responsibility for personnel in his Basij unit. He had seen\ncivilians beaten and had handed over civilians for mistreatment. The appellant\nhad been a voluntary member of the Basij. Citing the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees, the Secretary of State found that membership of a\ngroup responsible for indiscriminate killing and torture of civilians raised a\npresumption that the individual contributed significantly to the commission\n1 The appellant was represented by Mr Raza Husain QC and Ms Melanie Plimmer, instructed by\nMessrs Jackson & Canter. The respondent was represented by Mr Charles Bourne, instructed by the\nTreasury Solicitor.\n2 Prepared by Mr D. Regan.\nAA-R (IRAN) v. HOME SECRETARY\n185 ILR 403\n403\n', 'of violent crimes. The appellant, in providing organizational assistance to such\nan organization, was complicit in crimes against humanity. The appellant’s\nfailure to seek to curb the behaviour of his subordinates provided serious\nreasons for the Secretary of State to consider that he bore command responsibility\nfor crimes against humanity. The appellant argued that he had\nattempted to remonstrate with his superiors and reproached his subordinates\nabout their violent activities and that he had not personally inflicted physical\nviolence on civilians.\nFollowing the Secretary of State’s decision to refuse asylum, the appellant\nappealed to the First Tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum), which rejected\nthe appeal. It found that the appellant could not escape the definition of\ncomplicity by stating that he did not actively take part in acts of violence. It\nalso concluded that the appellant had made a significant contribution to the\nBasij’s ability to commit crimes against humanity and thus fell within Article\n1F(a) of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, 1951.3\nThe appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum\nChamber). He argued that the judge had erred in assessing his responsibility\nfor the acts carried out by the Basij and failed to have regard to relevant\nmatters. The Upper Tribunal concluded that, under Article 25 of the Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, 1998 (“the Rome Statute”),4 the\nappellant was guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity by virtue of his\nassistance to the Basij. It found that the Secretary of State had not relied on the\nappellant’s responsibility for acts of his subordinates, rather on his own acts. It\nalso agreed that the appellant had been complicit in the general acts of the\nBasij. The appellant appealed.\nHeld:—The appeal was dismissed.\n(1) Evidence of assisting an organization involved in the commission of\nwidespread violence was sufficient to satisfy the mental element of complicity\nin crimes against humanity in Article 7(1)(k) of the Rome Statute.\n(a) The appellant’s own evidence of his role in the Basij demonstrated the\nmens rea. The appellant had knowledge of the group’s activities and had\nintent, whether unwillingly or with regret, to contribute to these activities.\nHe had witnessed the brutality of the Basij and seen people tortured but\ncontinued handing people over for torture. That, without more, was sufficient\nto establish complicity (para. 26).\n(b) The appellant’s role as a commander in the Basij further evidenced his\nsubstantial contribution to the Basij’s ability to operate. An organization such\nas the Basij would be assisted by an individual such as the appellant, who\nassisted in the persecution of civilians and ignored acts of serious violence,\n3 For the text of the relevant part of Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention, see para. 5 of the\njudgment.\n4 For the text of the relevant part of Article 25 of the Rome Statute, see para. 11 of the judgment.\n404 ENGLAND (COURT OF APPEAL)\n185 ILR 403\n', 'especially given that he had put his substantial administrative skills at the\ndisposal of the Basij (para. 27).\n(c) In taking an overall view of the appellant’s contribution to the Basij, the\nTribunals were entitled to place weight on the appellant’s own account of his role\nin the Basij, particularly his disregard of mistreatment of civilians. On his own\nevidence, the appellant had full knowledge of the Basij’s activities. By virtue of\nArticle 25(3)(d) of the Rome Statute there were serious reasons for considering\nthat he had voluntarily contributed, significantly, to the Basij’s ability to commit\ncrimes against humanity. By virtue of his rank as commander in the Basij, he\nunderstood the aims and methods of the organization and shared its common\npurpose. There were serious reasons for considering that the appellant was\ncomplicit in the commission of international crimes. There was evidence that\nhe had made a sufficient contribution to the acts of an organization that had\ncommitted war crimes. Since he was aware of these activities, he was complicit in\nthose acts. Actus reus was irrelevant; complicity went to mens rea (paras. 28-31).\n(2) Since the first ground of the appeal was dismissed, there was no basis\non which to examine the argument that the Secretary of State’s decision was\nbad for want of proper, adequate or clear reasons (para. 32).\nThe following is the text of the judgment of the Court of Appeal,\ndelivered by Rafferty LJ (with whom Tomlinson LJ and Sir Stanley\nBurnton agreed):\n1. In a determination of 16 August 2010 the FTT [First Tier\nTribunal] allowed an appeal from the 22 June 2010 decision of the\nSoS [Secretary of State] in reliance on Article 3 of the ECHR [European\nConvention on Human Rights, 1950] but upheld her decision to\nexclude the Appellant from refugee status since he had committed a\ncrime against humanity. On 9 October 2012 Rix LJ gave permission to\nchallenge the 29 July 2011 conclusion of the UT [Upper Tribunal]\nupholding the decision of the FTT.\n2. Ground 1 is that the UT erred in finding that the Appellant made\na significant contribution to the general acts of the Basij. He argues that\nhis local role and involvement in propaganda, budgetary and social\nactivities did not cross the threshold for “significant contribution” so as\nto render him complicit in those general acts. In concluding to the\ncontrary the UT failed to have regard to a mandatory relevant consideration,\nthe size and nature of the Basij in Iran.\n3. Ground 2: The UT’s decision is bad for want of proper, adequate\nand clear reasons. If the Secretary of State or the UT sought to rely on\nthe local acts of the Basij as the relevant crimes against humanity (they\ndid not) it was incumbent upon them to identify those acts so that they\ncould be clearly advanced and tested.\nAA-R (IRAN) v. HOME SECRETARY\n185 ILR 403\n405\n', '4. The overwhelming majority of the evidence was not in dispute.\nThe Basij is a paramilitary force which enforces ideological and what it\nconsiders to be Islamic values in Iran. The Appellant held the highest\nrank in his village, in command of 30 men in his district. He accepted\npresence on patrol duty outside his village, where he witnessed acts of\nviolence and, in his contention reluctantly, handed people over to\ncolleagues who beat them. Such local beatings were not identified as\ncrimes against humanity but relied upon to show his significant contribution\nto the Basij’s general acts.\nTHE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n5. Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention reads where relevant:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect\nto whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\nhe has committed . . . a crime against humanity, as defined in the international\ninstruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such\ncrimes; . . .\n6. Article 12(2)(a) of the EU Qualification Directive is in\nidentical terms.\n7. It is for the Secretary of State to prove on the balance of\nprobabilities that an individual should be excluded: Al-Sirri.\n8. The leading domestic case on Article 1F(a) is R (JS (Sri Lanka))\nv. SSHD [2011] 1 AC 184 (“JS”). Lord Brown said: “because of the\nserious consequences of exclusion for the person concerned the article\nmust be interpreted restrictively and used cautiously”.\n9. The Rome Statute, the contemporary international instrument\nfor Article 1F(a) purposes, is the starting point. Article 7, where\nrelevant, defines “Crimes against humanity” as:\n(1) . . . any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or\nsystematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of\nthe attack:\n(a) Murder;\n(b) Extermination;\n. . .\n(e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty . . .\n(f ) Torture;\n. . .\n(h) Persecution . . . [on grounds which are] political, racial, national, ethnic,\ncultural, religious, gender . . .\n406 ENGLAND (COURT OF APPEAL)\n185 ILR 403\n', '(i) Enforced disappearance of persons;\n. . .\n(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great\nsuffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.\n10. In SK (Zimbabwe) v. SSHD [2012] 1 WLR 2809 (“SK”) the\nCourt of Appeal considered the definition of “other inhumane acts of a\nsimilar character” under Article 7(1)(k). Rix LJ said:\n. . . the critical feature of the requirement of “similar character” is that “other\ninhumane acts” should be, by their nature and the gravity of their consequences,\nof comparable (“similar”) character to the other enumerated\ncrimes . . . What constitutes “other inhumane acts” of similar character is, of\ncourse, a matter of evidence, but also for judgment, and may depend on all the\ncircumstances of the case.\n11. Article 25 of the Rome Statute regulates individual criminal\nresponsibility for a crime against humanity falling within Article 7.\nArticle 25(3) provides:\n3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible\nand liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if\nthat person:\n(a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or\nthrough another person, regardless of whether that other person is criminally\nresponsible;\n(b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact\noccurs or is attempted;\n(c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets\nor otherwise assists in its commission or its attempted commission,\nincluding providing the means for its commission;\n(d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission\nof such a crime by a group of persons acting with a common purpose.\nSuch contribution shall be intentional and shall either:\n(i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal\npurpose of the group, where such activity or purpose involves the\ncommission of a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; or\n(ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit\nthe crime;\n. . .\n12. Article 28 of the Rome Statute—command responsibility—\nprovides that military commanders and superiors shall be criminally\nresponsible for crimes committed by forces under their effective command\nand control, or by subordinates under their effective authority\nAA-R (IRAN) v. HOME SECRETARY\n185 ILR 403\n407\n', 'and control, as a result of failure to exercise proper control over such\nforces or subordinates, where they knew or ought to have known that\nsuch crimes were being or were about to be committed, and where they\nfailed to take all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent their\ncommission.\n13. Article 12(3) of the Qualification Directive provides, inter alia,\nthat Article 1F(a) applies not only to those who personally commit\ncrimes against humanity but also to those “who instigate or otherwise\nparticipate in the commission of [crimes against humanity]”.\n14. In JS, Lord Brown said that the language of relevant provisions\nwas wider than joint enterprise liability under domestic law. Accordingly,\n“. . . article 1F disqualifies those who make a substantial contri-\nbution to the crime, knowing that their acts or omissions will facilitate\nit . . . [R]esponsibility will attach to anyone . . . contributing to the\ncommission of such crimes by substantially assisting the organisation to\ncontinue to function effectively in pursuance of its aims.” As to the\nmental element, “if a person is aware that in the ordinary course of\nevents a particular consequence will follow from his actions, he is taken\nto have acted with both knowledge and intent” and therefore mens rea\nwould be established if “the accused had personal knowledge of such\naims and intended to contribute to their commission”. Lord Hope said\neach case turns on its facts.\nTHE BACKGROUND\n15. The Appellant, born on 9 January 1984, is a citizen of Iran. He\narrived in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2007 and claimed asylum\nthe following day. The Secretary of State’s decision letter rehearsed his\nactivities with the Basij and accepted the credibility of that aspect of his\naccount. Her justification for exclusion was:\n(i) There were serious reasons for considering that the Basij conducted\nwidespread and systematic attacks against the civilian\npopulation, which amount to crimes against humanity;\n(ii) The Appellant bore command responsibility for those crimes;\nfrom 2004 he bore command responsibility for some and then\nall personnel in his Basij unit;\n(iii) During his checkpoint duties whilst a commander he saw people\nbeaten or handed over for further mistreatment;\n(iv) His failure to seek to curb the behaviour of his subordinates\namounted to serious reasons for considering he “bore command\nresponsibility for crimes against humanity”;\n408 ENGLAND (COURT OF APPEAL)\n185 ILR 403\n', '(v) The UNHCR’s view was that “where a group is involved in\nindiscriminate killing, attacks on civilians or torture, voluntary\nmembership raises a presumption that the individual contributed\nsignificantly to the commission of violent crimes, even if this is\nsimply by substantially assisting the organisation to continue to\nfunction”. Since he was a voluntary member of the Basij, he was\ncomplicit in its crimes against humanity.\n16. She relied upon general acts of the Basij as the crimes against\nhumanity, and on local acts to support the Appellant’s complicity in them.\n17. Variously to be found in his interviews and in his statement\nwere a number of concessions. Those relevant are as follows:\n18. The Appellant joined the Basij aged 12 in 1995. He became an\nactive member aged 16 in 1999. In 2004 he won “Basij of the year” and\nbecame commander in his village. He was mostly in charge of propaganda,\nnot involved in military matters, his motivation primarily reli-\ngious. He was known and respected in his village where no violence\noccurred under his command and it would not have been condoned. His\nprimary concern was to organise social, sports and religious events. He\nhad not personally been involved in violence against Iranian civilians but\nhad witnessed such when he and his men patrolled or manned checkpoints\nin the border town of Miyaneh, where he was not in command.\n19. He wrote:\nI was afraid to remonstrate with the commanding officer and I felt it was not my\nplace. However, upon returning to the village I did reproach some of my men.\nI would tell them our role is preventative rather than punitive and that it was\nstrictly illegal to ill-treat prisoners. Some of them accepted my criticism and\nsome frankly did not. They would say they were punishing those who worked\nagainst Islam . . . I witnessed no ill-treatment in Alnajaroq . . . a small village and\neveryone knows each other. My colleagues would never be allowed to get away\nwith that kind of behaviour in the village . . . I was responsible for managing our\nbudget. These were funds allocated to us by central government.\n20. His evidence was that:\n(i) On a monthly basis he took a group of 10 on patrol for law enforcement\npurposes. He referred to his success at recruitment, increasing\nhis command to 100. Those under his command acted as his ears and\neyes. He was hated in Iran. People saw him and ran away.\n(ii) Most of his colleagues were awful and mistreated young people. He\nclosed his eyes to this. He did not mistreat people but had to hand\nover people who were then very badly mistreated by others. He was\nunder pressure to arrest people and his colleagues beat the detainees\nas soon as they were arrested.\nAA-R (IRAN) v. HOME SECRETARY\n185 ILR 403\n409\n', '(iii) He witnessed lashings, and beating with batons and with sticks.\nWhoever was arrested by the Basij, before going to court, had to\nbe beaten up. He had not seen anyone die but had seen many\nunconscious after beatings and torture.\n(iv) He did not beat people himself and was reported by his colleagues\nfor being too soft. Because of his softness he could go into the\ncommunity and attract them. They needed a person like him.\n(v) In 2006, disillusioned, he gave helpful information undermining\nthe effectiveness of the Basij. In March 2007, told that the Etelaat\nwere looking for him, he left Iran.\nTHE FINDINGS OF THE TRIBUNALS\n21. The FTT Judge concluded that the Basij were involved in a\nwidespread or systematic attack against the civilian population. The\nAppellant had contributed in a significant way to its operational ability\nbecause he continued to turn up for work, to turn a blind eye to\nviolence and ill-treatment when he was on duty and to command\nothers whom he knew used violence.\n22. The Judge said:\nThus the Appellant’s own evidence in addition to all the other background\nmaterial before me leads me to conclude that the violent activities of the Basij\nin carrying out its perceived duties do form part of what can be regarded as a\nwidespread or systematic attack designed to maintain control over the Iranian\ncivilian population generally.\n[Counsel] fairly acknowledged that the Appellant was in difficulty so far as the\nmental element required under Article 1F was concerned. The Appellant was\non his own evidence a committed and respected member of the Basij of some\nlocal rank. He accepts that his participation was on a voluntary basis. He\ncannot escape the definitions of complicity . . . by stating that he did not agree\nwith or actively take part in acts of violence. This is because he nevertheless\ncontinued to turn up for work, to turn a blind eye to violence and illtreatment\nthat occurred when he was on duty and to command others in\nhis group whom he knew used violence . . . I find that he did contribute in a\nsignificant way to the Basij’s ability to operate and therefore to pursue its\npurpose of committing crimes against humanity as defined by the Rome\nStatute. I also find that he must have been well aware that his assistance in\nthe functioning of the Basij would further that purpose. He has admitted as\nmuch, in saying as part of his case that he began after 2006 to question the\nchoices he had made.\n410 ENGLAND (COURT OF APPEAL)\n185 ILR 403\n', '23. In the UT there was no challenge to the factual findings of the\nFTT. The Appellant argued that the Judge had erred in assessing his\nresponsibility for the acts carried out by the Basij and failed to have\nregard to relevant matters. The UT concluded it was not part of the\nSecretary of State’s case that the Appellant was responsible for the acts\nof those under his command but rather for his own acts. Article 25 was\nat the heart of the appeal. The FTT was entitled, in reliance on the\nlocal acts, to find him complicit in the general acts of the Basij.\n24. Mr Husain QC for the Appellant sensibly agreed with me in\ndialogue that were he unsuccessful in challenging complicity, his appeal\nfails without more.\n25. He argued that to qualify as crimes against humanity local beatings\nshould have been specifically identified and then one by one\nadvanced so as to permit testing of precisely what happened and when.\nThis was important since it would have been necessary to determine\nwhether, when the Appellant handed people over, the ill-treatment they\nreceived was sufficiently severe as to be proscribed by Article 7(1)(k).\n26. There are major difficulties in Mr Husain’s way. The Appellant’s\nown evidence made out the mental element. He knew of the\nBasij’s activities and intended, even if on his own account unwillingly\nor with regret, to contribute to them. These were serious incidents. He\nhad seen victims unconscious after beatings and torture but continued\nhis practice of handing people over for beating. His evidence of events\nat the checkpoint was without more ample to establish complicity.\n27. If, and I do not, I needed fortification of my view I should find\nit in an analysis of the effect of his position. An organisation such as the\nBasij would be assisted in its purpose of persecuting the civilian\npopulation by loyal members who would take command responsibilities\nand turn a blind eye to serious violence. Still more would it be\nassisted by individuals skilled in budgeting, recruitment and propaganda.\nThose details demonstrate his substantial contribution to the\nBasij’s ability to operate.\n28. In taking an overall view of his contribution to the Basij, the\ntribunals were entitled to attach weight to his own words, that he\nclosed his eyes to “awful mistreatment”. The answer to the Appellant’s\nsubmissions on this point is well expressed in the judgment of the UT\nand in the decision letter of the SSHD [Secretary of State for the Home\nDepartment]. The UT wrote:\nHe was a local commander and although he had not committed any acts of\nserious ill-treatment himself his own evidence was in reality that he had been\ndirectly complicit in them when he had handed individuals over knowing that\nAA-R (IRAN) v. HOME SECRETARY\n185 ILR 403\n411\n', 'they would be seriously ill-treated. He clearly on his own evidence had full\nknowledge of the Basij’s activities. Given this evidence it was in our judgment\nproperly open to the Judge to find that the Appellant was complicit in crimes\nagainst humanity by the Basij by virtue of Art. 25(3)(d) in that there were\nserious reasons for considering that he had voluntarily contributed in a\nsignificant way to the Basij’s ability to commit crimes against humanity.\n29. The SSHD wrote:\nIn summary your long-term membership of and promotion to a responsible\nrank within and recognition of outstanding achievement by the Basij mean\nthat you would have understood the aims, methods and activities of each\norganisation and would have shared a common purpose with the organisation.\nThere are therefore serious reasons for considering that you were both complicit\nin and had command responsibility for international crimes.\n30. The issue in this fact-specific case is in my judgment complicity.\nI struggle to understand how, having conceded all he knew, saw,\ntolerated and continued to embrace, the Appellant can hope to persuade\nus that complicity was not made out. This was a man who\nwatched lashings, beatings, torture and use of batons, and having\nwatched them sent yet more arrested individuals into the hands of\nthose who had inflicted those indignities.\n31. Complicity, Mr Husain agreed with me, goes to mens rea. An\nactus reus need not trouble us since the Appellant made so many\nconcessions. Once there is evidence that he made significant contributions\nto the acts of an organisation of whose malign activities he was\naware, he is complicit in those acts.\n32. There is nothing in his first Ground. Consequent upon\nMr Husain’s concession it is unnecessary for me to consider his second.\n[Report: Transcript]\n412 ENGLAND (COURT OF APPEAL)\n185 ILR 403\n']</pre>
