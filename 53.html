        <pre>['Sam Dubin was in his shirt\nsleeves. It was a part of his regular\nSaturday routine to descend the five\nflights of winding stairs leading\nfrom his top floor rooms on Forsyth\nstreet. On these occasions he never\nbothered with changing his costume.\nHe felt perfectly happy as he was.\nBesides having his sleeves rolled up,\nhe permitted himself the luxury of\nfreedom from a collar. A rusty col\nlar button dangled from the loose\nflap of the neck band in token of\nthe fact that a collar sometimes\nformed a part of his scheme of dress.\nSaturday night marked the climax\nof Sam\'s pleasure hunting.

Besides, while he sipped\nthe nectar he always allowed his\nthoughts to wander to the pinochle\ngame in prospect at Harry Schneid\nerman\'s on Eldridge street. Sam on\na Saturday night reached the high\ntide of his Epicureanism.\nAs he stood before the stand in\ndulging himself he suddenly turned\npale.

The memory of the Macca\nbees and their pious and intrepid\nfollowers, and of their heroic ex\nploits is well worthy of being thus\nhonored and glorified.\nMany are the unforgettable les\nsons that those valiant spirits of\nold taught all succeeding genera\ntions of Israel. First" and fore\nmost is the lesson that a people that\nlias an indomitable will to survive\ncannot be destroyed. This lesson\nsank deep into the consciousness of\nthe Jew. It intensified and made\never more determined his will to\nlive. And the Jew has lived on,\nHrhen other groups long ago gave up\n|heir ghosts.\nEqually valuable is the lesson that\na righteous cause must and will\nTHE AMERICAN JEWISH WORLD\ntriumph in the end, if only the fight\ners for it have the necessary power\nof endurance and resistance. A\nrighteous cause often loses its battle\nwhen its protagonists are too hasty\nin their surrender. But given suffi\ncient time, the oppressed will wear\nout the oppressor. History is full\nof illustrations of this truth.\nOf special importance to us at the\npresent time is the example of the\nMaccabees and their followers in\ntheir attitude to the foreign world\naround them and its culture. The\nGreek world and the Greek culture\nthat surrounded them on all sides\ncould not fail to exercise a power\nful attraction and influence upon the\nJews of that day. In Egypt the\nclose contract between Judaism and\nHellenism resulted in new creations\nof the Jewish spirit. The amalga\nmation of the two cultures bore nob\nble fruit in the intellect of a Philo.\nThe Jew has never despised and re\njected that which is really worth\nwhile in the spiritual possessions of\nothers. But when the apostates of\nJudea, urged on by their Hellenic\nabettors, showed their eagerness to\nsurrender and abandon everything\nthat the spirit of Judaism had cre\nated for itself, in exchange for that\nwhich was most ignoble and de\nbased in the life of the Greek world\naround them, then every loyal heart\nin Israel rebelled. That has many\ntimes repeated itself in our history.\nLe$ our modern contemners of\nJudaism and our renegades take\nnotice. The apostasy of some only\nstrengthens the loyalty of the oth\ners. The modern Jew in all liberal\ncountries, like the Jew of ancient\nAlexandria and of medieval Spain,\nhas adopted that which is best in the\nlift, wisdom, and virtue of his neigh\nbors and has thus enriched our own\nJewish treasures. But he knows\nthat after all that which is essen\ntially his own, the Judaic element of\nhis soul-life, is his greatest posses\nsion and his most valuable contribu\ntion to the forces that make for the\nworld\'s progress and civilization.\nHe is, therefore, following in the\nfootsteps of the loyal Maccabees of\nold.\nFLAYING THE DE-JUDAIZED\nJEW\n"For the first time in the history\nof American Judaism, a recognized\nleader of the reform movement, Dr.\nSamuel Schulman, rabbi of Temple\nBeth-El, Fifth avenue and Seventy\nsixth street, yesterday attacked the\n1\nEthical Culture Society, of which\nDr. Felix Adler is the founder."\nThus reads the first paragraph of\nan account given in one of the New\nYork big dailies of a Thanksgiving\nsermon preached by Rabbi Schul\nman. That is all that the sage re\nporter knows about it. As a matter\nof fact, for years and years Dr.\nHirsch of Chicago has been having\nhis fling at the Ethical Culture So\nciety, its founder and his disciples.\nDr. Schulman\'s recent attack how\never, was prompted by a new book\nby Waldo Frank, "Our America."\nIn his book Frank says a few very\nuncomplimentary things about our\nEthical Culturists. He calls the so\nciety "a synagog without a God,"\nand says that Dr. Felix Adler\n"evolved an adulterated religion."\nAnd again: "The Society of Ethical\nCulture met their (the Jews\') prob\nlem. It was free, not only of the\nsuppressed demands of the Jewish\nsoul, but even of the odium of the\nJewish name." And Rabbi Schul\nman makes appropriate comments\non all these strictures.\nNow, attacking the Ethical Cul\nture society seems to us an alto\ngether futile and unnecessary thing.\nIt is not different from any other so\nciety that seeks to cultivate and\nspread an idea that is either non\nreligious or anti-reKgious. As a\nmatter of fact, Ethical Culture can\nnot be said to be an anti-religious\nmovement. It is a religious cult of\nits own kind, differing, of course,\nfrom all the other established faiths\nof present day civilized humanity.\nIn so far as it omits God from its\nscheme of things, it i$ act different\nfrom Buddhism.\nHowever, what provokes the an\nger and indignation of a red\nblooded Jew is to see Jews so eager\nly detach themselves from the syna\ngog and form new attachments with\nnew-fangled cults. Ethical Culture,\nChristian Science, Spiritualism, and.\nothers equally profound philosophic\nor scientific faiths have a sort of a\nfatal attraction for some of them.\nOf course, they have such a firm\ngrasp of the religion of their fath\ners and of the new cult, they have\nsearched so dilligently, and pene\ntrated so deeply into their doctrines,\nand precepts, that they can have no\ndoubt as to the superiority of the\nnew to the old. Some of the Jewisb\ndevotees of the new cults whom wte\nknow are profound students and\nthinkers. Their vast knowledge of\nJudaism in particular is remarkable.', 'But stronger than their genuine\nconvictions of the superior merits of\nthe new faith is their anxiety to drop\nand to lose the name Jew, if pos\nsible. It sometimes seems to us that\nthat is the real desideratum. Being\nJew or a Jewess is sometimes\nqtiite inconvenient for the profes\nsionally, or commercially, or social\nly ambitious. And if there is an\neasy and "smart" way of getting rid\nof this handicap, why not avail one\nself of it? If that is the case, let us\nnet blame rabbis, and other earnest\nminded Jews for being at times suf\nficiently provoked at such disloyalty\nand treason to the household of Is\nrael to indulge in a little flaying of\nde-Judaized Jews.—jS. N. D.\nOUR NEW YORK LETTER.\n(From the New York Bureau of The\nAmerican Jewish World.)\nA week of Relief Work—Jewish\n"Bank for War Victims—Jacob\nSchiff and the Loan—Interview with\nDr. Bogen.\nOwing to the many important\nevents which have taken place in\nconnection with the relief work of\nAmerican Jewry for our brethren\nacross the ocean, this week may be\nregarded as a great relief week in\nNew York.\nWithout doubt the most impor\ntant event is Mr. Warburg\'s declara\ntion concerning the loan bank and\nthe expedition department which the\nJoint Distribution Committee in\ntends to establish. The project is\nthat the Joint Distribution Commit\ntee should obtain ships for the send\ning of food to Europe, and on the re\nturn trip these ships are to bring to\nour shores the wives and children\nwhose bread winners are in Ameri\nca. In this manner the passage for\nthe Jewish immigrants will cost\nmuch less than steamship tickets\nbought from the regular steamship\ncompanies.\nThe American Government can\ncertainly be depended upon to direct\nher sympathy for the Jewish war\nvictims to the practical plan of plac\ning her own ships at the disposal of\nthe Jewish relief workers.\nThe people who are acquainted\nwith the situation in Washington\nexpect no objection from President\nWilson. The only question that re\nmains is whether Secretary Daniels\nhas the necessary ships available for\nour use.\nThe Loan Bank which is a project\nof the Joint Distribution Committee\nhas already received from Mr. Schiff\nTHE AMERICAN JEWISH WORLD\nthe promise that his bank will tttP\ndertake to float a loan which will be\nbetween 25 and 50 million dollars.\nAll Jews will be able to subscribe to\nthis loan which will be of the great\nest assistance to the Jews in Europe,\nand at the same time this money will\nbe a good investment, and will be\nprotected by Mr. Schiff\'s bank in\nAmerica. The bank will conduct\nthe loan on a sound commercial\nbasis and that will be the first sub\nstantial help that American Jews\nwill give, not as a contribution for\ncharitable purposes, but as -a\nbrotherly favor. It will serve to pttt\nthe Jews on the other side of the\nAtlantic on their own feet thru re\nestablished business and industry.\nMany prominent wealthy Jews of\nEurope would take part in the work\nof this bank. The Jewish business\nmen of Vilna express their willing\nness to buy shares in this bank, if\nJewish trade and commerce in their\ncity would be benefited thereby.\nDr. Boris Bogen has recently re\nturned from Europe and our repre\nsentative took advantage of the op\nportunity to have a talk with him,\nconcerning the Jewish situation\nacross the ocean.\nThe happiest bit of news that he\ntransmitted is that with the assist\nance of the American Government,\n325,000 Jewish children are being\nprovided with food and will continue\nto be so provided for until the com\ning summer and every city has\ncommittees consisting of Jews and\nGentiles whose duty it is to super\nvise the distribution of the food that\ncomes from America.\nThe saddest news that Dr. Bogen\nbrought is that Polish Jewry is dis\norganized and divided into too\nmany parties, and that the friction\nbetween these factions takes up the\ntime and energy that ought to be\ndirected toward building up Polish\nJewry, to whom the war has brought\nso much misfortune and ruin.\nFor those who are interested at\npresent in the protest movement\nagainst the pogroms in the Ukraine,\nit is worth knowing that the great\nprotest demonstration in Madison\nSquare Garden last summer saved\nat least 10,000 Jews in Poland from\na most certain death.\nAccording to Dr. Bogen many\npogroms had already been organ\nized, and were about to be made up\non the Jewish population in differ\nent places, but the huge Jewish pro\ntest in New York actuated the\nAmerican Government into taking\nAlbany, N. Y. (By I. J. P. B.)—\nGovernor Smith has appointed\nAbraham I. Elkus as Justice of the\nCourt of Appeals, the highest tri\nbunal in the State, to fill out the re\nmainder of the term, in the place\nleft vacant by the death of Justice\nWin. H. Cuddeback. Judge Elkus\nwill therefore serve until December\n31st, 1920, and it is expected that\nhe will be a candidate for the same\noffice in the election next fall.\nNEW YORK JEWRY \'PLAN-*\nNING PROTEST AGAINST\nUKRAINIAN POGROMS.\nNew York, (By I. J. P. B.)—No\nvember 24th is the day set for the\nmourning protest and mass meeting\nof New York Jewry against the\nUkrainian pogroms. At a confer\nence in Webster Hall of 600 dele\ngates representing 150 Jewish or\nganizations, plans for the demon\nstration were formulated, and\'\nmoney collected to cover its ex\npenses.\nAs in the demonstration last May\nagainst the Jewish atrocities in Po\nland, it was arranged to have Jew\nish places of business close at noon,\nin order that the workers may march\nin the mourning parade. Mayor\nHylan and the Board of Education\nwill be asked to permit the Jewish\nschool children to remain away\nfrom their classes on the afternoon\nof the 24th in order to participate\nin the parade. The procession will\nend at Carnegie Hall, where the\nmass meeting is to be held.\nAmong the speakers at the confer\nence in Webster Hall, were Hon.\nJoseph Barondess, Judge Gustave\nHartman, and Captain Blum.\n9\nenergetic measures to apprise Po\nland that it must do something to\nstop the Jewish bloodshed there.\nABRAHAM ELKUS APPOINT\nED JUDGE IN NEW YORK\nCOURT OF APPEALS.\nJVIr. Elkus, who is Chairman of\ntiie Governor\'s Committee on 1£e-r\nconstruction, has for some time been\nacting in an advisory capacity to\nGovernor Smith in matters of im\nportance. He has been referred to\nas the "Colonel House" of the state\nadministration. Mr. Elkus has also\nserved as Ambassador to Turkey,\nand has distinguished himself\nthroughout a long and active career,\nby his devotion to Jewish Welfare,\nand to the public interest in gen\neral. ...', 'a LOCAL NEWS—-ST.
