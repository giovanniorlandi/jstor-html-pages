This season, Albertas In\nGrady county are as scarco as grape\nfruit in Alaska.\nThat statement, however, dom not\napply to one spot In Grady county.\nSaid spot is u series of sand. hills,\nthe same being tho farm of W. M.\nSutrdivant located a mile from\nI.averty. This thrifty farmer has\nJust finished harvesting and selling,\naccent on the selling a crop of\nfrom 600 to 1000 bushels of peaches\nwhile his neighbors and those who\ni,aw his orchard wondered "how\ncome."\nTho reason that Grady enmity\nwent without, peaches this year Is\nsimple, though harsh.

After tho peach trees -had\nbeen preening about for a few days,\nlike a pen of peacocks nt a county\nfair, this Frost party and Boreas\ngot their heads together one night\nand ran the thermometer down be\nlow freezing with Hie result that,\nthere were few peach buds alive in\ntho county tho next morning.\nIf there were fo walive buds over\nGrady county as a whole that mom\ning. there wore as few dead otjh in\nthe orchard of Mr. Sturdivan, but\nduring the night thero was much ac\ntion in that orchard.

As tho peaches grew\nripe, willing buyers flocked there\nfrom many miles in automobiles and\ntho crop was -sold as rapidly as it\nripened and could be picked. The\nprices ranged from $1 to ?9 per\nbushel the latter price covering the\nloads that wero hauled to Cement,\nChickasha and other towns. Those\nwho journeyed to the orchard gladly\npaid a dollar a peck and for days\nafter the last peach had born hauled\naway, fruit hungry travelers con\ntinued to call at tho Sturdivant\nhome for more peaches.\nBuy Meat Market\nHere, to Remodel\nEntire Building\n, The City Meat market, llfi South\nThird was purchased yesterday by\nS.

Chaucer.\n"Normalcy" and "Old Times:\'\nnenntor Harding has been .saying in his speeches that he\n"wants to get back to normalcy," and Governor Coolidge professes\nto wish for a restoration of "old times," )\nThese gentlemen are candidates of the "Old Guard," and must,\ntherefore, voiee the wishes of the "Old Guard." The "normalcy"\nof "old times" Senator Harding wishes to get back to must be that\nof the good old, golden .Mark Upturn iKays, when an "Old Guard\'s"\neampaign fund exceeded $1 (i. 000,000 ; when a price was paid for\nt-leetions; when employees at great industrial plants were told by\ntheir superintendents, the agents of special interests, that unless\nthey voted as they (the representatives of special intrests) wished\nIhein to vote, their jobs would he closed to them on the day follow\ning the election; they were the days when corporation taskmasters\nwrung immense dividends from the very blood of women and\nchildren employed in unregulated "sweatshops."\nOn the other hand, in the days of "normalcy," in the "old\nlimes," there was no Federal Ifeserve system; panics were as fre\nquent and national bank failures occurred on an average of one\nevery three weeks; there was no Farm Loan system; small farm\ners were.ine victims or mortgage name pirates aim Tenancy was\nthe curse of the land; there was no Federal aid in road building\nand every farmer paid\' a "mud tax;" there was no merchant ma\nrine; there was none of the many beneficent legislative enactments\nof the last two Democratic administrations, which wrested the\npower of government out of the hands of a few and lodged it in\nthe hands of the people. In those days of "normalcy" an insidious\nlobby gnided the hand that wrote the laws placed upon the nation\'s\nslatutc books, until driven from the corridors of Ihe capitol as the\nmoney changers of old were lashed from the Temple.\nSuch was "normalcy" in the "old times" for which the "Old\nGuard," the agents of the special interests, speaking through its\ncar lidates, so frequently sighs.\ni it strange that IJepublicans of the progressive type are not\nenthusiastically taking to the Harding candidacy? One of the or\nganizers of Hie l\'regrcssive party in Illinois, Harold L. Hicks, who\nwas a delegate to the Chicago convention, has. issued a public\nstatement announcing that he cannot support the nominee. He\nsays :\n"Holding us 1 do that my duties and obligations as a citizen\nare paramount to my duties and obligations as a party man. I have\nconcluded to support the Democratic national ticket in this cam\npaign, said Air. Ickes, m a signed statement, I shall continue\nto affiliate with the Republican party, but I cannot in good con\nscience support for President a candidate who was Hot the real\nchoice of his party and whom I regard as unworthy and unfit to\nbe the chief executive of this nation by the tests of ability, public\npolicies, official record and independence, of character.\n"Senator Harding had an opportunity to repair the bad im\npression that his nomination created and his play-acting in the Mc\nkinley role kept alive by a clcarcut ami ringing speech of accept\nance that wouhl have lined him up squarely as a forward-looking,\nprogressively minded man. But once more he failed signally. His\nKpeech shows that he is not even satisfied to stand pat. He pro\nclaims himself a reactionary. He would turn back the hands of\nthe clock ami satisfy the aspirations of men\'s souls by talking of a\nfull stomach. No more uninspired and uinspiring utterance from a\npublic man is of record in American political history.\n"What Senator Harding believes in is not party government,\nbut boss control. He has the Mark llanna conception of party. He\nlooks upon the .Republican senate cabal as the Kcpublican hosts\nand deceives himself that when Senators Snioot and Watson and\nLodge, Murray Crane, Janves Hemingway and Col. Harve met\nprivately in a room in the Blackstone Hotel at 2 o\'clock in the\nmorning to decide upon him as the candidate and to determine\nhis policies, the Republican party was assembled together for solemn\ndeliberation."\n"Governor Cox\'s record is a distinctly progressive record.\nThat record proves that he looks upon office as an opportunity for\npublic service. He is standing in this campaign upon what he has\nachieved along progressive lines for the public welfare. His eyes\naie to the front, fixed on the future. He is not wabbling.

A\nn nn, iljl mr is c 11\nthe phonograph that is fea\ntured in Vaudeville \'s strangest act\nPerhaps you\'ve seen it Signor\nFriscoe\'s "Mugix:" Xylophone\nAct.\nIt\'s the hit of vaudeville\'s\n"Big-Time."\nSignor Friscoe\'s "magic" is an\nGlhcial Laboratory Model of\nthe New Edison. We have one\nexactly like it.\nSignor Friscoe\'s instrument is\nan exact duplicate of the origi\nnal Official Laboratory Model,\nwhich cost Mr. Edison three\nmillion dollars to perfect. Our\ninstrument is also an exact\nduplicate of this famous three\nmillion dollar original. We\nguarantee it to be able to give\nthe same marvelous Re\nCreat.ions of music, which\nSignor Friscoe\'s Official Labor\natory Model gives in vaudeville.\nCome in and test the astonish\ning realism of this instrument\nfor yourself in Mr. Edison\'s\nRealism Test.\nTie NEW EDISON\n1 The Phonograph with a Soul\nYou\'ve read how the New Edison has proved\nits perfect realism. Four thousand tests have\nbeen given, in which more than 50 different\nartists compared their art with its Re\nCeeation by the New. Edison. Leading\nnewspapers conceded that there was no dif\nference between the two.\nHas any one suggested to you that these\ncomparison tests are "faked" that the\nartist imitates the New Edison ?\nSignor Friscoe\'s performance makes such an\nassertion positively ridiculous. Every week,\n20,000 people see his hammers ripple over\n\' the xylophone keys. Suddenly he holds them\naloft still.\nThe. rippling music continues.\nSlowly, the gorgeous curtains of the back\ndrop part. The audience gasps. The New\nEdison stands revealed. It has takeu up\nSignor friscoe\'s performance, and is .now\nHii-CuEATiNc; it alone. The effect of this\nextraordinary magic can rest upon only one\nfact: No one can distinguish any difference\nbetween Signor Friscoe\'s performance and\nits Ke-Cheai\'Ion by the New Edison. Signor\nFriscoe could not possibly imitate the New\nEdison, because the xylophone can not be\nmade to imitate any other instrument, so as\nto deceive its hearers.\nSignor Friscoe\'s act is not an Edison enter\nprise. He has simply been clever enough\nto Use the New Edison for what it is worth.\nWhy don\'t you?\nPRICES\nThe price of the New Edison has increased\nless than 15 since 1914. This includes\nthe War Tax.\nMr. Edison has staved off price advances\nby personally absorbing more than half of\nthe increased cost of manufacture.\nBecause of the exceptionally high quality\nof materials and workmanship demanded\nby the Edison Laboratories, and the con\ntinued scarcity of both, it may be necessary\nto advance prices. But rest assured that\nthis will not occur, unless Mr. Edisoa is\nforced to it.\nOur Budget Plan the thrift way of spend\ning will help you buy now.
