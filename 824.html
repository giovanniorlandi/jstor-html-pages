At global level, \nthe changes refer to planetary-scale changes in the Earth system which consists of the land, \noceans, atmosphere, polar regions, life, the planet’s natural cycles and deep Earth processes \nthat its parts influence one another including human society. \nBeside the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the everincreasing\nhuman modification of other aspects of the global environment and the \nconsequent implications for human well-being. Social systems can also change rapidly and \ndiscontinuously in ways that may greatly alter environmental systems and human being. \nTo address the changes, the governments, public and private institutions and people are \nrequired to agree on the ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for \nenvironmental system management. The academic and scientific society that are believed to \nbe the most prepared in facing rapid global changes should take a lead in exploring the new \nway addressing the problem. \nWith purpose to comprehend any new initiative for managing the changes and keep the \nenvironment livable, this conference discusses in detail about the state-of-the-art of \nenvironmental management, technology, and methodology to address the changes at \ncommunity, city, regional and global levels. \n                                                 \n*\n Corresponding author: wismadi@uii.ac.id  \n  \n  , 0 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf /20192800MATEC Web of Conferences 280\nICSBE 2018\n6001 6001\n  © The Authors,  published  by EDP Sciences.  This  is  an  open  access  article  distributed  under  the  terms  of the Creative\nCommons Attribution License 4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). \n', ' \n \n2 Knowledge organization \nTo obtain clear overview of possible changes in the way to addressing sustainable issue, we \norganized the groups of initiatives, ideas, and possible solutions generated from research \nand academic activities which include local wisdom and global experience into five groups \nof focus: \n1.  Disaster Risk Management \n2.  Sustainable City  \n3.  Livable Rural and Urban Environment. \n4.  Green Infrastructure \n5.  Sustainable Resource Management \nFollowing the idea of Change Management (Kotter, 1996) which include: (1) Creating \nUrgency, (2) Form a Powerful Coalition, (3) Create a Vision for Change, (4) Communicate \nthe Vision, (5) Remove Obstacles, (6) Create Short-Term Wins, (7) Build on the Change, \n(8) Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture, we critically analyze where we are now and \nwhat should be the next. \n3 Are we in the right direction? \n3.1 Creating Urgency: Water \nThe sense of urgency has been disclosed by the distinguished speakers. Most of them \nbrought the issue on water, either on how the water is obtained, quality improved, cleaned \nor even how the water could transport or removing pollutant.  \nProfessor Thomas Boving for example, invent the new approach for pollutant tracking \ntransported by water with microscopic particle. Professor Tsair-Fuh Lin, Yi-Ting Chen et. \nal.  furthermore, aim to neurotoxin removal with oxidating treatment of water. Professor \nFusheng Li at the same time introduce new approach to apply biological filtration, activated \ncarbon adsorption and membrane filtration for improving water quality.   \n3.2 Form a Powerful Coalition: Water and its concerned institution \nWhile global concern on water is increased, local initiative toward the same direction also \ntake place. For example, Prof. Pranadhang et. al. who aim to mimic natural bioremediation \nfor water pollution might be aligned to the similar approach applied in Indonesia at by \nPrihatini et. al. \nThis is only one example indicating many scholars, and its institution could form a \npowerful coalition on working on together in sustainability issue. \n3.3 Create a Vision for Change: Balancing planet, people, profit (3P)   \nThe Honorable Mayor of Banjarmasin, Ibu Sina, starting the keynote speak with the vision \nof balancing planet (environmental concern), people (social inclusion), and profit \n(economic benefit) in the city of Banjarmasin.  \nProfessor Marcus Hackel is among scholar who take strong voice to balancing people \nthrough architectural artefact and balancing its interinfluencing to planet and profit. More \ndetailed action for balancing the 3P (Elkington, 1997) has been done by Mirwan, Putra and \nLestari who disclosing peat clay as a new source of material for removing pollutant or \n \n  , 0 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf /20192800MATEC Web of Conferences 280\nICSBE 2018\n6001 6001\n2\n', ' \n \ncatalyst for chemical process, and Winarno who seeking a new sustainable material for \nconstruction industry. \n3.4 Communicate the Vision: Honestly speaks the contradiction \nAgain, Professor Marcus Hackel is among the scholar who communicating the \ncontradiction present when we might endorse a sustainable policy. Contradiction might be \nbeneficial on one leg of P (Planet), however it might bring consequences for other P(s). \n3.5 Remove Obstacles: Addressing the contradiction \nIn this conference, even though not mentioning the contradiction, some scholars have been \nsystematically addressing the negative consequences. Among others are Mirwan and \nMediana et.al. If the negative consequences are not well addressed, it might create obstacle \non the social and political aspect that might stops the changes toward sustainability \n(Wiyatiningsih, Noviandri, and Ameen et.al). \n3.6 Create Short-Term Wins: Proof-of-Concept  \nIn this conference, all scholars presenting a quick-win, as the result of careful research and \nempirical observation indicating the new way of winning to be scaled up. \n3.7 Build on the Change: Scaling-up \nIn every concluded research, we show a quick-win, showing what went right, and what \nneeds improving. Most to the paper clearly articulated the future research need to be \nconducted. By articulating the future speculation clearly, we keep ideas the idea fresh, \ninviting new change agents and leaders for us to form coalition. \n3.8 Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture: Institutionalizing  \nWe, as part of scientific communities, who form coalition with government, business, and \ncommunity, in this conference series has been talking about progress every chance we get. \nHere we tell success stories about the change process and repeat other stories. \nThrough this way, we include the change ideals and values when we back to our \ninstitution and outreach the idea into our corporate culture to be contributed by all member \nand ensuring that our legacy is not lost or forgotten. \n4  New resources for managing the changes toward sustainable \nbuilt environment. \nFollowing the organization of themes, new ideas as the resources for sustainable built \nenvironment are summarized. \n4.1 Disaster Risk Management \nWith concern for measuring rural livelihood experience, Rudiarto et.al. started to explore \nand apply Livelihood Resilience Index for tidal prone area.  Tunas and Herman took further \ninvestigation on the effectiveness of normalization of river bank flood mitigation. The \n \n  , 0 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf /20192800MATEC Web of Conferences 280\nICSBE 2018\n6001 6001\n3\n', ' \n \neffort to prolong the function of other measure of river flow were applied on the \nconservation types of reservoir (Brontowiyono et.al.) and risk management during \nconstruction process (Devi et. al.). Moreover,  Miladan et.al. and Harjanti et. al. propose \nland use flood vulnerability maps in the process of urban planning and reservoirconstruction\nprogram.   \nTo address other type of disaster, Sastra and Idham propose a new approach for \nanticipating landslide event with introducing spatial configuration of landslide event \nclusters. This attempt is aligned with Pawirodikromo et.al. who develop a micro site \ncoefficient required for earthquake mitigation program in building design. \nAt building level, Idham disclosed the evolution of traditional architecture through \ncivilization process which influence the level of building safety under earthquake. In \nserving a more contemporary building design Teguh et.al and Pawirodikromo investigated \npartially strengthened structure on multi-story building.  \nAt micro level, Pratiwi et.al. learned that the type of construction material assembly also \ncontribute in increasing the risk for the disaster event. Furthermore, Abidin et.al. and Sigit \n& Azizah aim to address the risk of fire case in industrial sector and the risk of safety in \nconstruction sector using safety management systems.  \nFinally, all the scholars converge the opinion toward the fact that a comprehensive \napproach is required to mitigate all possible risk of any type of disaster.  \n4.2 Sustainable City  \nTo serve sustainable city, Saptorini investigate placemaking phenomena in urbanized \nriverside, its problem and the possibility to address the negative implication. Wulandari & \nAina, and Huzairin & Oktaviani,  Nugraha et.al., and Tohjiwa investigated the effect of \nplacemaking and urbanization to architectural spatial identity, typology, and morphology. \nTo address a space scarcity in a more competing urban activity, Wiyatiningsih and \nNoviandri propose a spatial negotiation approach for sustainable city. In an extreme case of \nurban-space competition, such as in a post-war country, Ameen et.al. reveal the fact that \nsustainable city could only be established through political stability. \nTo investigate placemaking phenomena, Budiman conducted a historical and \nlongitudinal global level investigation and disclosed planning conception for the structure \nof the cities. In a forward-looking perspective, Trisutomo et.al. successfully predict the \nfuture of the city to serve a more sustainable coastal area planning. \nAiming to serve sustainable city, one of vital component, such as transport systems need \nto be carefully planned. At network level, Wibisono and Suprayitno attempted to integrate \ninter-city and urban mass transport planning. At a more detailed level, Romadhona and \nIkhsan address sustainability issue in urban area by investigating the effect of U-Turn on \ntraffic performance. The improved performance of traffic to reduce the Green House Gas \n(GHG) emission is then calculated by Nugrahayu and Firmansyah. \nMoreover, Mediastika et.al., Darmawati, and Rini et.al., emphasize the critical \nimportance of mobility system to serve people with different ability, impaired people, youth \nand aging society. Therefore, a sustainable city should be supported by inclusive \ninfrastructure, including pedestrian (Yulia and Iftironi) and other mean of mobility to serve \nall group of society. \n4.3 Livable Rural and Urban Environment. \nRole of society in forming livable rural and urban environment is among interesting subject \ninvestigated by Raharjo. He defined as People-Driven Development (PDD) and leading to \npeople-driven urbanism. Moreover, Lukito and Zahra also learned that urban public space \n \n  , 0 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf /20192800MATEC Web of Conferences 280\nICSBE 2018\n6001 6001\n4\n', ' \n \ncould be enriched with public art and aesthetical element, and indeed greenery (Caesarina \net.al.). Lukito & Iskandar, Asmal et.al.. and Nugroho in specific have seen that the societal \neffort for living harmony with nature could be traced through their architectural artefact, as \nwell as its spatial track analysis of physical movement in response to natural circumstance \n(Astuti et.al., Aufa et.al.). \nTo support their civilization, people take resource from the earth, and its surface \nincluding the sea. Annisa et.al. investigate how mineral in the ground could provide sources \nfor a sustainable live. Besides, in the context of resource at the earth surface, Hasanah et.al. \nexplored a potential pathway for urban sustainability through urban agriculture initiatives to \naddress food scarcity. To obtain water, a study of flow parameter and river intake was done \nby Bakri et. al. Furthermore, Mujiyanti et.al.  and Syauqiyah et. al. demonstrate the \npossibility to desalinate water. At more advance level, Hasanah et.al. disclose the evidence \nthat a System of Rice Intensification (SRI) could address water use management, as well as \nreducing greenhouse gas emission.  \nThe concern on GHG reduction both in urban and rural area is one of the focus of the \nscholars, Samodra investigate the contribution of traditional houses in rural area in reducing \nenergy consumption that lead to GHG reduction.  \nWhen people live on earth they also produce waste, including the wastewater that leak \nto the waterbody and river. The analysis of temporal variation of water quality along the \nriver was conducted by Fajri et.al. To mitigate the effect of domestic wastewater \nRahmawati et.al. and Yulianto et.al. investigated the effectiveness of chemical and physical \nparameters, including aerobic granular in the function of communal wastewater treatment. \nFurthermore, a more careful investigation of water treatment unit has been done by Yamada \net.al. and Juliani et. al. \nTo improve the environmental quality of accumulative waste at surface area in a coastal \narea, the flushing method in polder drainage system also discussed by Wahyudi et. al.  \n4.4 Green Infrastructure \nMoreover, for a better living, green infrastructure is required. Various type of public \ninfrastructures such as social housing, hospitals, education facilities and public spaces were \ninvestigated by Wijaya et. al., Samudra and Sudarma, Handoko, and Santi et. al. Other \ntypes of infrastructure discussed were transportation (Prayudyanto and Tamin), drainage \n(Astuti and Anggraheni), logistics of construction industry (Mursadin), and \ntelecommunication (Khatimi et.al.) as well as IT technology (Alkaff et.al). The discussions \nalso include infrastructure governance, with the case of aerotropolis development (Berawi \net.al.).  \nThe intervention possibility could be done through ecological architecture (Handoko), \nbuilding retrofitting (Fasna and Gunatilake), building shape formation and construction of \ngreen roof (Hendrawati and Putra), building foundation systems (Ma’ruf et.al.), vegetation \narrangement (Samodra and Sudarma) and construction material advancement (Krasna et.al., \nNurwidayati et.al., and Arsyad et.al., Chairunnisa and Fardheny, Arifin and Rahman, Tata \net.al., Prasetia and Rizani, Putri and Lisdiyanti, Utami et.al.).  \nAt macro level, the planning approaches for urban configuration, the infrastructure \nnetwork, its service delivery and pricing strategies were discussed by Berawi et.al., \nPrayudyanto and Tamin, Amri et. al. At this level, the progress of green infrastructure \ndeployment and city sustainability could be monitored with Green Configuration-Based \nGIS spatial model. \n \n  , 0 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf /20192800MATEC Web of Conferences 280\nICSBE 2018\n6001 6001\n5\n', ' \n \n4.5 Sustainable Resource Management \nAgain, the most concerned resource to be maintained sustain is water. All the scholars in \nthis topics deal with water resource. Rahayu and Rini, for example observed the socioeconomic\ndeterminant of water consumption. Siswoyo et. al., aim to address water \npollution from the use of detergent, while Meadows et.al. and Hadjeres et.al. focus on \naddressing the toxic by-product of water treatment plant, and Nurmiyanto & Ohashi, and \nIslami et.al.  aim to organic removal process. Ni’mah et.al. more specific aims to address \nthe contaminated water from mining, while Warmadewanthi et.al. focus on the excess of \nfertilizer industry contaminating water body. \nOther scholars investigate the water quality of surface water and rivers (Anggraheni and \nGustoro, Marlina and Melyta, Nugroho et.al., Sriyana, and Rusdiansyah et.al.). Riduan \net.al. then expand the investigation into a tidal swampland suitability for agriculture \ndevelopment using GIS spatial model. \nMoreover, beside dealing with water, a specific attempt to explore the waste treatment \noption to GHGs emission was also done, by Meidiana et.al., to disclose the fact that the \nattempt to better living might bring a consequence for others. In the case of an excessive \nland resource occupation for example, it creates erosion and sedimentation on watershed \narea.  \nTo mitigate a risk of land resource occupation, Ariyani et. al. test an evaluation \nmechanism for assessing the use of resource for a landfill systems of municipality solid \nwaste management. An attempt to address cross-cutting issue of disaster and resources from \nthe waste was discussed by Yusriansyah et. al. They addressed both optimized use of waste \nmaterial and a more lightweight concrete adaptable for earthquake effect anticipation. \nKasam also working on optimization of waste, with emphasize on reduce, reuse and \nrecovery concept. Similarly, Wijayanti et.al. successfully exercise demineralized risk husk \nwaste for biofuel source. \nOther critical resource, but often overlooked, is the time. Anggraini et.al. and Yuliana in \nspecific aim to manage the time as a critical resource to be managed properly especially in \nthe construction process. \nOne of the critical factors of the effective use of time resource is human resources \ncapacity. Irawan and Utomo, disclose how the leadership plays an important role in \nimproving workforce performance in construction industry. \n5 Concluding remark \nWe all together, in the 5\nth\n ICSBE, 2018 have provided evidences of our intention, and \ncapacity in change management for livable environment. All our effort serves the purpose \nto comprehend any new initiative for managing the changes and keep the environment \nlivable. We have the state-of-the-art of environmental management, technology, and \nmethodology to address the changes at community, city, regional and global levels. \nNevertheless, we should continue our effort. With consider that a better life needs to be \nsupported by invention and innovation, let me again to articulate the way of Prof Hackle \nthat emphasizing on solving problem with contradiction. New invention, could only \ngenerated if we could determine an inventive problem (San, 2014). A problem with \ncontradiction. In this case, we should not only balancing people, planet and profit through \noptimization approach, but beyond that, we must push-forward the new solution while at \nthe same time also inventing other solution for the worsened situation. \nTherefore, in this opportunity, let me propose the potential theme for future, the 6\nth\n \nICSBE, conference theme to specifically focus on Inventing Solution for Sustainable Built \n \n  , 0 (2019) https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf /20192800MATEC Web of Conferences 280\nICSBE 2018\n6001 6001\n6\n', ' \n \nEnvironment. I believe, with our continues effort and commitment we could contribute the \nbenefit not only among us, but also for our future generation. \nBibliography \n1.  Elkington, J. (1997).
