E.\nCopeland from Waiukoa grammar\nschool to the Wailuku high school\nMr. Vincent of Huelo will succeed\nMr. Copeland at Waiakoa.\nIt was feared that several of our\nbest teachers would resigu on ac\ncount of the reduction of salaries, as\nin many Instances teachers\' sala.ries\nave been cut to a point where they\nare simply insufficient to support the\nteachers. It is the general opinion\nhowever that the legislature will\nhave to make ample appropriations\nfor public school teachers, and prob\nably this is why more teachers have\nnot resigned.\nThe new high school builciing in\nVailuku will not have been complet\ned in time to bo occupied at the op\nening of the term, consequently Mr.\nCopeland and his corps of assistants\nwill occupy the old building for the\nnext six weeks or two months, by\nwhich time t\'oo now building will be\nready for occupancy.\nHowever -pupils desiring to enroll\nfor the higher branches of study can\nenter at once a3 Mr. Copeland is\nprepared to givo them special atten\ntion. Tbiis will bo something long\nwaited for in Wailuku, and many\nparents in this district, some of\nwhom have scarcely been ablo to do\nso. have been compelled to send their\nsons and daughters to Honolulu to\nobtain anything beyond an ordinary\nDrlmary school education.\nAll this is changed now, .and the\nBoard of Public Instruction in Hono\nlulu will do their full share in deve\nloping tho school in Wailuku to one\nof tho leading high schools on the\nIslands. They have agreed to equip\nthe school with all necessary appli\nances and it is beyond doubt that in\na few years the Wailuku high school\nwill be in tho front rank of ednca\ntional institutions on tho Islands.\nTho Public School Department\nbuilded more wisely than they knew\nin giving us a One high school build\ning in Wailuku, and havo followed up\ntheir good work by selecting as\nprincipal a gentlemen thbroughly\nqualided in every respect to build up\nour high school into an institution of\nwhich the people of Wailuku, in com\nraon with all the people of Maui will\nhave cause to feel alike proud, and\ntho News strongly urges tho parents\nof Maui to grenerally support our\nnew school.\nMr, Copeland states that he will\nlusist on tho cultivation of a high\nmoral tone among tho children in the\nschool room and in the school grounds,\nespecially in their \'language, thus\nEDMUND Hi HART\nNotary Puiilio, Conveyancer and\nTypewriter.\nAqent to GiiANtf \'Marriage License\nOffice, .Circuit ColirtWhd Circuit.\nwiping out a stigma from which our\ngrammar school has not at all times\nin tho past been entirely free. In\nthis connection, the News desires to\nespecially pompliment Mrs. McKay,\nthe late principal, for the splendid\nwork she has done in clovating the\nmoral tono as well as tho manners of\ntho children who for the past severo?\nyears have been under her charge.\nTho \'advanced classes will doubt\nless draw a large attendance of Maui\nchildren, especially those of central\nMaui, and with trains running from\nPaia, Puuncno and Spreckelsville,\nmany parents from up country will\nbe ob\'o to avail themselves of the\neducational and industrial training\nwhich our new high school will offer.\nWailuku, Waikapu and -Wattieo will\nalso add a- large contingent, so that\nit Is only a question of time until ad\nditional rooms will be needed in the\nhigh school grouuds, which are amply\nlarge enough for that purpose.\nThe people of Maui rtro also to be\ncongratulated on what tho Board of\nPublic Instruction are doing for La\nhainaluna. While it is believed that\nLahainaluna will eventually be endow\ned by tho United States as an agricult\nural college, still every energ\'., is\nboing bent by the Territorial author\nities to build up i prand industrial\ninstitution at Lahainaluna, and under\ntho able management of Mr C. A.\nMcDonald and his corps of assistants\nthe school is rapidly gaining its old\ntime renown as one of our leading\neducational institutions.\nSt. Anthony\'s School at the Cath\nolic Mission under charge of Brother\nFrank, also opens next Monday. The\nexcellent work which this school has\'\ndone in tne past has given it an en\nviable reputation, and the News be\nspeaks for it a large attendance.\nCanon Ault will open his private\nschool Monday and anticipates having\nabout tho same-numbers of scholars\nas last year.\nMaunaolu Seminary in the Maka\nwao district will commence its school\nterm September 14.\nSTRENGTH-OF\nWORLD\'S NAVIES\nBureau of Intelligence of the United\nStates Make Valuable Com\nparisons LOSS OF PORT ARTHUR FLEET\nWould Cripple and Place Russia\nIn Filth Place of Navies;\nIn making a general statement of\nthe relative strength of the navies of\ntho world, it is necessary to define\nclearly tho basis on which such estim\nate is made. Otherwise, tho com\nparison is apt to bo misleading. A\nfew months ago the Bureau of In\ntelligent of the United States navy\nmado some valuable comparisons,\nbased upon its own invaluable sources\nof information, in ono of which the\nnavies were compared on the basis\nof the number and displacement both\nof the warships actually completed\non January 1, 1904, and tho other on\nthe number and displacement both of\ntho warships actually completed and\nof those under construction at that\ndate. In theso estimates no account\nis taken of gunboats and other ves\nsels of loss than 1,000 tons displace\nmcnt, nor do they include trans\nports, dispatch vessols, converted\nmerchant vessels or yachts, or obso\nlete cruisers. Vessels, moreover,\nthat are authorized, but upon which\nno actual work of construction has\nbeen done. Vans excluded from tho\ni\ncomparison\nAt\' tho outsot, attention should bo\ndrawn tb the fact that although , the\nUnited Ssates has a most liberal pro\ngramme of construction in hand, the\ngreat delay in completing our ships\ncauses us to make a relatively poor\nshowing in a comparison of vessels\nactually completed, the United\nStates coming fifth on tho list and\nbelow Russia and Germany. Further\nmore, were the vessels which are now\nbuilding for the various navies of tho\nworld completed, the United States\nwould movo up from fifth to third pos\nition, with Germany fourth ar.d Rus\nsia fifth. About a month after the\npublication of these tables by the\nBureau of Intelligence, the war be\ntween Russia and Japan opened with\nthe loss of several vessels of the\nRussian navy, and such serious dam\nage to others, that they must of\nnecessity bo deducted from tho total\navailable ships of the navy. This has\nbeen dono by reckoning tho battle\nship "Petropavlovsk," the cruisers\n"Voriag," and "Boyarin," the tor\npedo transport "Yenesei," and tho\ngunboat "Kbrietz" hopelessly lost.\nIf tho battleships "Czarevitch,"\n"Retvizen," and "Pobieda," and\ncruiser "Pallada," which, after huv\ning been repaired sufficiently to be\ncome oncomoro an activo fleet, were\nto be destroyed either by tho Rus\'\nsians themselves, to avoid their fall\ning into Japaneso hands, or\' by tho\nJapaneso in a sea fight, the subtrac\ntion of this tonnago of about 70,000\nfrom the Russian total would cause\nRussia to drop from third to fourth\nposition, Germany taking her place\nin the relativo standing of tho navies\nas they now are. The same trans\nposition has to bo mado in the table\nshowing the comparative strength of\ntho navies, were the ships that are\nnow building completed, .Germany\ncoming fourth, or next to the United\nStates, and Russia filth.\nIt would be mere guesswork to en\ndeavor to modify the second compar\nison by the losses which may occur to\nboth tho Russians and Japaneso be\nforo tho war is mided. If the Baltic\nfleet should be sent nut, and succeed\nin raising tho siego of Port Arthur,\nthere might be a great naval engage.\nment, attended with such a serious\nloss of Japanese sh\'ps,as would throw\nback the development ot this the\nyoungest amoner the navies, for a full\ndecade. On tho other hand,if,as it now\nbegins to look possible, tho Baltic\nfleet be not sent out, it is likely that\nPort Arthur and Vladivostock will\nbe captured, and\' the whole Asiatic\nfleet of Russia destroyed or taken. If\nthis should occur,it would involvo the\nloss of the cream of the Russian navy,\nEince for tho past few years, tho new\nRussian ships, as they havo been\ncompleted, have been dispatched to\nthe Far East. Tho total loss would\nincludo seven battleships, four armor\ncd cruisers, seven protected cruisers,\nand a few gunboats, making a total\nof about 170,000 tons. In this case\ntho Russian total; if all the ships now\nunder construction were completed,\nwould be about 388,875 tons. She\nwould still rank fifth in point of dis\nplacement, or about 60,000 larger\nthan Italy, but a long way bolow tho\nnext nation, Germany. This, how\never, is mere speculation; and wo\nhavo only changed tho figures of the\ntables of tho Bureau of Intelligence\nho far as thoy aro actually affected\nby the war, to tho extent of includ\ning in the totals for Japan tho two\ncruisers purchased from Chile, and\nby subtracting from tho Russian\ntotals the vessels known to bo lost or\nseriously disabled.\nThe total tonnago of vessels built\nand building for Great Britaln,narae\nly, 1,867,250 tons. Tho next largest\ntotal to that of Great Britain is that\nof France, 755,757 tons: then comes\ntho United States with 016,275 tons\nGermany with 505,619 tons; Russia\n488,732 tons; Italy, 329,257 toils; and\nJapan, with 253,681 tons.

Further, that duplicate copies be\nfurnished the Delegate with com\nplete copies of correspondence.\nI also requeat the same procedure\nbe at once had as to the moneys\nexpended by the Territory of Ha\nwaii in dredging Honolulu harbor\nand channel from Juno 14, 1900, to\nthe date of the most recent expen\nditure, bearing in mind the fact\nthat tho Federal Government does\nnot dredge berths or slips.\nThis method of presentation will\nbest bring these matters to the at\ntention of Congress as being in re\ngular order, having the recommen\ndation of tho responsible depart\nments. Your Delegate can then advance\nand work for these measures before\nthe Departments, in Committee and\nand before the House.\nThe Delegate has another re\ncourse by introducing House Rills,\nin which he has tho promise of the\nmost effective aid, hut the above\ncourse is preieraoie.\nI desire to repeat the need of\nprompt action.\n1 beg to remain, sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed) J.

It should be remem\nbered the Federal Government\nnever dredges berths or slips except\nfor its own accommodation.\nSllell a fnlirua u,tllll n.l tr n n.tn - .\npreliminaries and aid the Delegate\nto secure prompt results.\nThe bill for the survey of Hilo\nharbor has already been introduced\nand is now before the Committee\non Rivers and Harbors, and has\nbeen partly considered by them,\nand it is not unlikely an item will\nbe inserted in the estimates for\nthin object.\nThe bills for Public Buildings at\nHonolulu and Hilo have been in\ntroduced and referred to tho Com\nmittee on Public Buildings.\nChairman Gillet will require ab\nsolute proof of the necessity of\nthese buildings, and much data has\nbeen furnished. The clyinces for\na building of moderate cost at Hilo\nare better at the coming session\nthan a very expensivo one at Ho\nnolulu.
