The army and\nhas arrived in New eaiana no\nports that he succeeded in reaching\nlatitude 88.23, within 111 geographical\nmiles of the South pole. This was\ndone after a sledge vayage of 1.708\nmiles, a record for Antartic explora\ntions, although not a record when\ncompared with some of the feats ac\ncomplished every winter by Alaska\nmushers. The expedition, as a matter\nof fact, reached 354 miles nearer the\npole than the previous expedition on\nthe Discovery, in which Lieut. Shack\nleton participated.\nAs a feat, this ranks among the very\nfirst in the matter of polar research,\nand the scientific results accomplish\ned by the expedition also place it\namong the most successful in modern\ntimes. The southern magnetic pole\nwas reached and located by a separate\nparty from that which made the long\ner voyage, and its location was fixed\nat about latitude 73 degrees 20 min\nutes south and in longitude 146 east,\nby observation. This in itself makes\nthe expedition noteworthy.\nWhen the fact is taken- into con\nsideration that the ice cap in the\nSouthern hemisphere extends much\nfurther from the pole than is the\ncase in the Northern, because it is\ncolder in the Southern than it is in\nthe Northern hemisphere, the magni\ntude of the work done can be better\nunderstood. The failure to reach the\npole was due simply to the fact that j\nprovisions were m danger ot exnaus\ntion and a return was inevitable- As\nit was, the expedition touched the\ndanger point closely, provisions being\ncompletely exhausted twice a consid\nerable time before the caches were\nreached on the return vayage.\nImportant contributions were made\nto geographical science as a result of\nthis work, and a showing was made\nwhich warrants a belief that some\nfuture expedition will be able to\nreach the South Pole, following lines\nidentical with those of the Shackle\nton expedition.

"There was\nsomething inspiring about the condi\ntions there, something well worth\nwhile telling about"\nIt was quite apparent Miss Warren\nwas well pleased with her inspection\nof the Clifton school. It is taught by\nMiss Elsie Conklin. It is a small,\nbut comfortable and modern school\nhouse. There are on an average\nabout 20 pupils. The greatest num\nber registered this year was 23. The\nteachers of this county, and the many\nothers who are interested in educa\ntional matters, and who also know\nMiss Warren well, will be pleased to\nread an account of her trip to this\nschool\nI found the school in perfect\nshape," said Miss Warren, "and fl\nwas such a pleasure to enter a school\nroom and find everything just as it\nhould be. There wasn\'t a thing\nould criticise, but it was not alone\nthat there wasn\'t anything of a nega\ntive nature that might be pointed out,\nfor the best of it all was the positive\nenthusiasm which was evident every\nwhere\nPerhsps it is not every teacher who\nwins such praise as Miss Warren\ngave to Miss Conklin, and the As\ntorian hopes it is not over stepping\nthe modesty inherent in the proprie\nties of praise when it publicly tells\nof the fine things said of this country\nschool teacher.\' "One of the nicest\nthings that I learned." went on Miss\nWarren, "was that the teacher had\ntaught four of the elder girl pupils\nhow to sew, and under her inspection\nthe girls had each made a dress. One\nof the girls was wearing her dress\nwhen I was there, and it was very\nneat and becoming. The girls had\nbeen taught to sew and make dresses\nafter school, and what pleased me\nwas the cheerfulness with which Miss\nConklin did this. Instead of com\nplaining of the work she had to do.\nshe was looking for opportunities for\ndoing all she could to help these\nchildren in their lives.\n"In the coming teachers institute,"\nwent on Miss Warren, "1 am going\nto ask the teachers this question\nWhy Are You a Teacher?"\' and it\nwas evident that Miss Warren\nthought that Miss Conklin\'s actions\ndenoted that she is a teacher because\nshe love the work, and realizes the\ngreat dignity of it, and is not teach\ning simply because she finds it a\nmeans to earn a few dollars.\nIt is a pleasure to state that Miss\nWarren finds other teachers in the\ncomity who are perhaps equally de\nserving of the fine praise that is\ngiven to the Clifton school ma\'am.\nIt requires but little thought to per\nceive what a great influence a teacher\nlike Miss Conklin can have on the\npupils entrusted to her care- There\nis no church or Sunday school at\ni Clifton, and the influence of the\nteacher will unquestionably be last-\nitiur \'on manv of the pupils. Four of\nthe pupils of the school have gradu\nated and are now in the Portland\nliiirh school. It is also pleasant to\nstate that the good people of Clif\nton seem to appreciate the services\nof Miss Conklin, and they Ijave in\ncreased her salary as much as they\ncould, and now pay her $70 a month.\nA\nH.\n& M.\nCLOT H E S\nOnly the best.\nZojmlfht 1909 Vf Hut Scktifiiff Mart\nSnappy New 1909\nsp SHIRTS P\n$1,00 to 32.50\nHome of Hart, Schaffner & Marx Clothes\n4tt ,mi-nn HselMMt\nat a lower rate this figure does not\nrepresent the total increase of the\npension rolls sn account of special\nlegislation.\nSince the close of the Civil War,\nin 1865 there has been paid in pension\nthe sum of JJ.654.653.J6S and the cost\nof maintaining pension aencies and\nadministration of the pennon bureau\nhas been $112,854,477.\nIn 1902 there were 999,446 pension\ners on the roil t an expense of $137,\n504,267.

Astoria would not stoo at\nnything of that sort and the celerity\nwith which the matter haa been ar\nranged and closed, is proof of the\nvery strong concern this city has in\nthe up-rearing of this fine essential\nimprovement.

The play is all that was ex\npected as a vehicle for fun, amuse\nment and delightful music; it is of a\nsort that makes for endless entertain\nment, and was devised as a kind of\ncornucopia of light and laughter and\nlavish diversion; its construction and\ntrend was faithfully held by the\nscores of clever people assembled on\nthe stage, and there was not an idle\nmoment in the ISO it took to unravel\nthe pleasant string of revelry. The\nElks\' orchestra was in command of\nthe music of the night and contribut-\nimmensely to the genuine success\nrecorded. The house was generous\nth its applause, and there was\nample to evoke it. The house was\npractically sold out, and today\'s\nhouse is half gone before the day\ndawns and . tonight\'s entertainment\nwill be no less delightful than was\nthat of last night. It is likely to be\nbetter and smoother for the work\ndone so appreciably at the first per\nforniance; at all events no one will\nmiss anything by being on hand to\nnight, and it looks as if "the whole\ntown would be out."\ni\n!!\n"A.

There are various changes\nthat will have to be made, and one\nthing desired is to ascertain with ex\nactness just what graves and lots\nhave been sold in years gone by. It\nseems that quite a few years ago the\nrecords in relation to the cemetery\nwere not kept with the exactness\nthat would have been expected in\nsuch a matter, and there are said to\nbe many graves of which the rec\nords have been lost or are so badly\nmixed up that little can be told of\nthem. Of late years, however, the\nrecords are kept finely, under an ex\ncellent system. It is also proposed to\nlay out in regular form the old part\nof the cemetery, where many graves\nwere dug years ago, and to do this\nwill require that the coffins be taken\nup and changed over into the new\npart- It is also stated that the Pot\nters Field is not in the right place;\nit is right at the main entrance in a\nprominent situation. It is also said\nthat the county has never made any\narrangement with the city for bury\ning the county poor in the city ceme\ntery.

W. Partridge, brother of the\nPrincess, when shown the letter de\nclared:\n"It is the work of some malicious\nperson. My sister never dreamed of\ngetting a divorce. She and the\nPrince are the happiest of couples.\'\n"Then in a burst of illumination, he\nsaid: \'My sister, Mrs. Sargent, got\na cablegram from her just a few days\nago that she and the Prince were\ncoming home together, and would be\nin New York Wednesday,\'\nMr. Partridge did not know the\nboat on which the Princess is a pas\nsenger and long distance telephone\ncalls to Mrs. Sargent were fruitless.\n"Putting two and two together, it\nis apparent that the letter was mailed\ntwo days before the steamer sailed,\nand if it were written and forwarded\nby some malicious female she evident\nly timed her efforts to make all the\ntrouble possible.\n"It is a certainty that the statement\nthat the Princess had begun proceed\nings cannot be true.
