The business men fear that\nthis strike will be the most serious to\naffect their interests in years. The\nstrike was called by a committee ap\npointed at a meeting of 1,000 freight\nhandlers held last night. The commit\ntee was instructed to call a strike\nwithin 48 hours, unless the railroads\nshould meet t\'he demands of the men at\nonce for an increase in wages, extra\npay for over time and holidays, and\nrecognition as a union. The action on\nthese instructions was taken sooner\nthan expected.\nIt was all but Impossible for any\nfreight to enter Chicago, or to leave It\ntoday. Many of the railroads had\nsmall forces of men previously hired on\n\'hand when the strike was called and by\nadding to it men from other depart\nments, managed to handle the perisha\nble commodities. In hiring nonunion\nmen it is said the railroads run the ser\nious risk of bringing ubout a strike of\nthe teamsters, who recently won their\nfight from the packers. The teamsters\nit is said will refuse absolutelly to\nhave anything to do with freight in\nany way handled by the non-union\nhelp. The men called out include fore\nmen, check, re-eheck, receiving and de\nlivery clerks, sealers, callers, welgh\nmasters, stevedores, coopers, and ele\nvator men.

M., July B, 1002.\nDuring the past week the two com\npanies which \'have been supplying this\ntown with telephone service passed un\nder one management; the Braley-Haf-ey\nCompany sold and conveyed its\nfranchises, lines, phones, etc., to the W.\nE. Baker Company. This is a desired\nImprovement, for with two systems of\nlines, some persons being on one sys\ntem andothers on another line, much\ninconvenience resulted.\nF. C. Braley left last week for "nis old\nhome at Ontario, Kas., expecting to re\nturn in about two weeks. . He is of the\nkind of men this territory needs.\nParties here have in contemplation\nthe purchase of the lands and buildings\nof the former Shalem colony, situated\nabout six miles north of\' this town.\nThere are about 1,800 acres In this tract\nand more than $100,000 have been spent\nupon it in constructing an irrigation\nplant and buildings and in making oth\ner improvements. The present scheme\ncontemplates interesting eastern capi\ntal In the enterprise and the erection of\na large and commodious sanitarium. In\nother words, it is proposed to establish\nand equip for the world at large what\nthe government of t\'he United States\nhas done for its consumptive sailors at\nFort Stanton, a short distance north\neast of here, and for its soldiers at Fort\nBayard, a short distance west of here.\nThe long drouth in this section was\nbroken on Monday last by a slight fall\nof rain. It heralded the beginning of\nt\'he rainy season and was witnessed\nwith joy. The last rain prior thereto\nin this section fell on the 15th of No\nvember last. The range is consequent\nly very dry and in this valley crops are\nsuffering very much. Some alfalfa\ngrowers have had two rather short\ncuttings of alfalfa, but others only one\ncutting. The wheat crop from San Mi\nguel northward has been harvested and\na fair yield bad. Bx) from San Miguel\nsouthward, I am told that the crops\nhave been practically lost. The fruit\non the trees is also suffering. Peaches\nand plums are just coming into the\nmarket. The present drouth and scarci\nty of water in the Rio Grande have\nemphasized the necessity of devising a\nsystem of irrigation by the use of\npumps and gasoline engines. There is\nno scarcity of water a few feet below\nthe surface all throughout the valley,\nand as the time in each year when the\nuse of pumps and engines is very short,\nthere seems no good reason why such\na system may not be successfully and\nprofitably established. This is the\nopinion of many of the most successful\nfarmers, and it would seem that Just as\nsoon as the first plant shall have been\nput In and Its success demonstrated\nthere will be a rush in that direction.\nThe Fourth of July was celebrated at\nLas Cruces with a game of baseball\nbetween the married men of the town\nand the single men.

The band is com\nposed in the main of the juniors of the\ntown, and as this is their first appear\nance in public there was much curiosi\nty to see them in their new uniforms\nand to hear them play. ,\nThere has been much interest taken\nhere in the matter of the omnibus\nstatehood bill. The people here are\npractically-unanimous In their desire\nfor statehood, but many look for radi\ncal amendments to the bill by the sen\nate committee.\nHon. H. D. Bowman left on Wednes\nday last with his family on a short trip\nto points In southern California. Judge\nParker also went to Santa Catallna Is\nlands. Later the judge will take a run\nup to San Francisco, and thence to\nMichigan, where his relatives reside.\nThe judge is one of the hardest work\ning judges on the bench in any state or\nterritory, and deserves his holiday.\nThe new machinery for the Modoc\nmine, in the Organ mountains, Is dally\npassing through town.

Money\nspent for public improvements is never\nspent foolishly and may be repaid dou\nbly in a very short time.\nThe delegates from New Mexico to\nthe National mining congress to be held\nat Butte, Mont., should make it a point\nto attend that gathering. The mining\ninterests of the territory are of great\nimportance and are growing steadily.\nNew Mexico should be represented at\nthat meeting.\nPresident Roosevelt will make a de\ntermined effort to have the next con\ngress pass legislation that will curb the\ntrusts. The president knows what the\ncountry stands most in need of and al\nso what will send him to the White\nHouse a second time with the greatest\nmajority ever given a candidate for the\npresidency,\nin unicago, on July 4, there were\neight heat prostrations; at Leadville,\nColo., and Sheridan, Wyo., it snowed,\nat some other towns not far from San\nta Fe, it blew a 40-mile an hour gale;\nat Omaha, Neb., the hail did immense\ndamage; while at Santa Fe the weather\nwas just rig1it, as it nearly always is.\nCome to Santa Fe to spend your sum\nmer. Tt is said in Washington that United\nStates Senator Beveridge of Indiana,\nwill be a presidential candidate on the\nRepublican ticket in 1898. If this is\ntrue, the senator ought to help the ter\nritories of New Mexico, Oklahoma and\nArizona to become states. The people\nof these three commonwealths will not\nforget their friends when occasion of\nfers. The state of Virginia will soon have\na new constitution, in which the dis\nfranchisement of the average colored\nvoter Is made very complete. This sort\nof business may do for a while, but It\nIs but a question of time, and a short\ntime at that, before the voters of this\ngreat Country will settle it in a manner\nthat will not be very pleasing to the\nmen who manage the constitution mak\ning business In the southern states.\nOomproiulse,the county debt and put\nthe financial condition of Santa Fe\ncounty in better shape.

T. Arnold lias\nbeen acquitted of tile charge of having\ndirect knowledge or complicity In the\niil treatment of Filipinos. This means\nbut little satisfaction to the Boston\nsoftheads who believe that Avar is a\nparlor game something like ping-pong\nand that when a Filipino gets hurt in\nthe course of buttle it is such a wanton\ncruelty that the ottlcer In command\nshould be court murtialed. Fortunately,\ncourt martials are not composed of men\nsuch as are found among the Boston\nanti-imperialists.\nThe British coronation day was ob\nserved on the Hawaiian Islands by or\nder of the governor of that outlying\nparcel of the United States. No harm\nwas done but naturally there were\nquite a number of Yankee residents at\nHonolulu who did not like the idea and\nwho will take up the matter with\nWashington. It would seem that the\nUnited States could furnish a sufficient\nly long list of national holidays itself\nwithout it being necessary for an Am\nerican territory to celebrate the British\ncoronation.\n"The Democrats and Pops of South\nDakota have effected fusion and reaf\nfirmed the ambulance platforms of 1806\nand linio. Hryanism continues strong in\nthe jack rabbit political camps."\nWashington Post.\nBryanism may continue strong in\nSouth Dakota, but it has no standing\nwhatever in the territory of New Mex\nico in which the Republicans elected\ntheir delegate to congress in 1898 by\n2,00o majority, In 1900 by 3,500 majority,\nand expect to elect their candidate for\ndelegate in 1902 by from 4,000 to 5,000\nmajority and this upon a sound money\nplatform.\nNineteen nominations made by Pres\nident Roosevelt during the recent ses\nsion of congress failed of confirmation\nby the senate and four were flatly re\njected. President Roosevelt Is wisely\ngoing over the endorsements of the\nnineteen not confirmed and also .over\nthe charges that have been made\nagainst them. If he finds that these\nmen really are not lit and do not de\nserve the office to which they are ap\npointed, he will not name them for re\ncess appointments, but ir otherwise, he\nwill stick to them as long as he can do\nconsistently. That is the kind of a man\nthe American people admire.\nA tricky convict who escaped from\nthe Oregon penitentiary \'has for several\nweeks successfully resisted the authori\nties of Oregon and Washington, al\nthough he has kept within a few miles\nof large cities, and posse after posse\nhas been sent after him. He has hy\nthis time killed \'half a dozen men and is\nstill as free ins a bird. With\' regular\nconvict humor he has sent word into\nSeattle that he Is going to loot a cer\ntain saloon and gambling den, and he\nopenly defies the authorities to catch\nhim. Evidently the Robin Hood days\nare not yet passed and those seeking\nfor material for a comic opera need not\ngo back several centuries to find it.\nPresident Roosevelt evidently has but\nlittle faith In the man with a political\npull. He has ordered an amendment to \'\nthe civil service code as follows: "No j\nrecommendations for the promotion of,\nany employe in the classified service\nshall be considered by any officer con-\ncerned in making promotions except it j\nbe made by an officer or officers under\nwhose supervision of control such em- I\nploye is serving; and such recommen- j\ndations by any other person with the\nknowledge and consent of the employe\nshall be sufficient cause for debarring\nhim from the promotion proposed and I\na repetition of the offense shall be suf\nficient to cause removal from the ser\ni\nvice." In other words, the man with a\npull will be at a disadvantage compar\ned with the man who has no backing\nexcept a good record.\nThe Lithuanians, Polanders and Sla\nvonians of the anthracite coal regions\nhave hit upon the right method of fight\ning out the strike in the coal regions.\nInstead of loafing around the mines,\nliving on charity or permitting their\nfamilies to suffer from want, they pro\npose to go elsewhere looking for work\nand to earn a living. That is true Am\nerican principles, if you do not like the\nwork and wages at one place you are\nat liberty to go and try your luck else\nwhere for sooner or later you will\nstrike the place where you will be paid\nwhat your work is worth. That is far\ndifferent, but certainly more manly\nthan destroying property or preventing\nother men from working.\nInformation from Washington is to\nthe effect that when the senate ad\njourned the omnibus statehood bill\ncould count upon a majority of seven in\nthat body. It is expected upon the re\nassembling of congress this will be in\ncreased to at least 15. The advocates\nand friends of the statehood movement\nfor the three territories have five\nmonths wherein to work and if they do\nso energetically, efficiently and in the\nright direction, favorable consideration\nof the bill by the senate is assured, al\nthough it must be expected with\namendments. Whatever these latter\nmay be, however, they will be accepted\nby the people If a definite date for the\nadmission of these territories is fixed.\nSix months or a year and even longer\nto wait will not make much difference.\nThe certainty of statehood within rea\nsonable time is what the people of the\nterritory desire, and if this is given\nthey will be satisfied.\nWANTED We pay cash for clean cot\nton rags suitable for machine pur\nposes.

A Kansas city man nas learnea\nto appreciate what delay means.\nMr. James Kgan of 1612 St. Louis\navenue, Kansas City, Mo employed\nby the Abernathy Furniture Co., says;\n"I first felt kidney complaint six or\nseven years ago.

"I am very glad to hear it," replied\nthe old magician, "for I am becoming\nolder every day, and the fountain of\nyouth has run dry. When you grow up\nyou will find that a long boardS-espe\ncially after it Is white is one of the\nmost valuable parts of a magician\'\nstock in trade.\n"But, father," the young magician\nwent on, as the other turned away and\nopened a large book of charms, "I wish\nyou would listen to me fura minute. I\nonly spoke of my mustache because\nwell, because I feel that I might go out\ninto the world and do something for\n...... .\n"\nI The old magician only sninea.\nI The young magiclnn talked a little\nwhile longer, but his father wouldn\'t\neven pay any attention, and went on\nreading the big book as quietly as if\nthere was no one else around. Seeing\nthis the young magician suddenly\nturned on his heel and left the room,\nin ut tering angrily to himself and slam\nming the door so violently that the\nold magician started and dropped his\nspectacles.\n"Goodness me! how noisy children\nare!" said the old gentleman. Then,\nwithout rising from his chair, he\nstretched out his hand and took his\nmagic wand from the corner of the\ntable before himNHe waved the wand\nin a circle and then tapped it seven\ntimes on the floor.\nA whiff of blue smoke curled from a\nJapanese jar that stood on a shelf near\nby, and formed itself into a tiny fig\nure in Japanese costume.\n-"Puff," said the magician, "my son,\nTendragon, Jr., has just left the room\nin a rage, slamming the door in a most\nunpleasant manner. 1 think he means\nto run away from home. Will you be\nkind enough to make yourself invis\nible and go after him? Let me know\nwhat he is doing. Don\'t stop him, but\nreport to me all he does.\n"Yes, master," Puff answered, and\ndisappeared.\nThe old magician went on with his\nreading for a short time, and then was\ninterrupted by the smell of perfumed\nsmoke.\n"Ah. Puff." he said, raising Ma\nhead, "are you back already?"\n"Yes, master," was the answer,\nthoutrh nothine was visible in the\nroom. "Master Pendragon has taken\nour scond-hest wand "\n"But it was in the secret cuproard."\n"He opened it."\n"How?"\n"He just opened it," said Puff.\n"Ah, the boy does know something,"\nsaid the old magician, uneasily.\n"Yes, master." Puff answered; "and\nthen he went to his own roord, packed)\na knapsack, returned, went to the\ncourtyard, changed the house-dog Into\na living griflin "\n"Very clever," the old man Inter\nrupted.\n"And flew southwest," Puff con\ncluded. "Very good. Get baek into you\njar."\nThen the old magician rose, took his\nwand again from the table, changed\nhimself into a dragon fly, and flew\ntli rough the window.\nMeanwhile Pendragon, Jr., was on\nhis way to Wales, where he meant to\ntry his fortune as a magician on his\nown account, The griffin flew at the\nrate of 83 miles an hour, and before\nlong had descended upon the top of\nMount Snowdon, where Pendragon,\nJr., alighted, and drawing from his\nknapsack a sandwich and a cold flask\nof magic lemonade, refreshed himself\nafter his journey.\nAs he rested there\' a large dragon\nfly came and lit upon a flower stalk\nDear him, waving its wings up and\ndown as naturally as possible.\nWhen Pendragon, Jr., had finished\nhis lunch he rose and descended, the\nmountain, using the second-best magic\nwand as a walking-stick. The dragon\nfly flitted along in the same direction,\nnot coming too near, but never losing\nsight of the young man.\nAs the young magician came to the\nfoot of the mountain he turned into a\nthick grove of trees, and then pro\nceeded to tear great jags and tatters in\nhis clothing. He then took off his\nshoes and rubbed them with rough\nstones and clay until they were ap\nparently worn and stained by long\ntravel. His clothes likewise were pow\ndered and soiled until he looked like\na youth who had been begging his way\nfrom door to door.\nThe drag-fly, who had been watching\nall this from under a broad leaf, re\nmarked to Itself, in n tiny voice: "This\nis very surprising, indeed!"\n. Having made himself look like a\nbeggar lad, Pendragon. Jr., came from\nthe grove into the valley below, and\nsoon after entered a little village, and\nstopped nt the door of a ponr cd tnge\nthnlched with straw. He knocked nt\nthe door, and a gentle voice from within\ncried: "Pull the string, raise the latch,\nand come in!" \'\nPendragon, Jr., entered, and the door\nwas closed so quickly behind him that a\ndragou-fly who followed just escaped\nbeing caught between door and door\npost. Pendragon, Jr., found himself within\nthe little cottage, and in the presence\nof an old, old woman, and n beautiful\nyoung girl. He took off his tattered\ncap, and bowed low. "May I rest here\nfor awhile?" he asked.\n"Who are you," and where are you\nfrom?" asked the old woman.\n. "A homeless young man," he replied,\nJThm Bnt and Most Influential\nMining Paper In (A World.\nPUBLISHED WUKLY, 18.00 KB VEAH.\nSPECIMEN COPY FREE.\nNew York, i\n255 Broadway.\n"who has only his head, his hands, awl\nthis good staff wherewith to make hii\nway in the world."\n\'"Hut you have a pair of feet," safdj\nthe old woman, sharply, "and yot\nmicrllf Iff tlluirt nni. ...... .... 41., .el\nwho have better mean, of making yot\ncomfort m V\n\', g runny, sam me liiume.n;\n"the young man seems wenry. \'Tls true 1\nwe have little, but that little may bd :\na blessing to him with less.

Sho\nseemed about to speak, but sighed and\nsaid nothing.\n"Dame," said Pendragon, Jr., to the\nold woman, "you have a bitter tongue.\nBut it may be that I can convince you\nI am no idling vagabond. 1 said I had\nonly my good staff to depend upon;\nbut still there are worst friends than\na good staff.

Let me giro\n. ., .,..\nyou a notion of its powers.\nau saying, ciuunifu, i .,\nto the door, and seeing the dragon-fly\nresting on the fence-rail, he suddenly\nwaved the wand and pronounced a few\nmagic words. This was done so quick\nly that even if the dragon-fly had\nknown what was to be done it could\nhardly have escaped. As it was, the\ninsect could not move before it wob\nchanged into a beautiful little white\npi?, which squealed with astonishment\nrage.\nPendragon, Jr., was laughing heart -\nily at the antics of the little animal,\nwhen he was amazed to see the old\nwomen jump toward him. He tried\nto avoid her, but she was as spry as\na cat, and before he could get away\nshe seized the second-best wand from\nhis hand. Then she began to wave it\nover her head and to dance about with\nglee.\n"Oho and aha!" she cried; "a brave\nyoung man art thou, O Pendragon,\nJrJ Thou wouldst be wiser than thy\nfather: and see what thou hast\ndonel Thou hast changed thy old\nfather into a white pig! Oho and aha!\nNow shall the young fool go to join\nthe old fool!"\nThe old woman waved the wand\nover her head, and behold! Pendra\ngon, Jr., became a white pig, Jr., and\nsquealed with rage and astonishment,\njust as the elder Pendragon had done\nonly a few moments before. As soon\nas the change was accomplished the\nold woman tried to drive the two\npigs into the pen that stood near the\ncottage.\nNow, all pigs are hard to drive;\nbut two magicians that have been\nchanged into pigs against their will\nare the hardest of all to drive. One\nran this way, and the other ran the\nother way, and the old woman\nchased them until she was tired and\nready to drop. Then she called to\nthe maiden who stood near, looking\nvery sad and very solemn at the\nsame time.\n"Come, Betty, thou lazybones, help\nme to drive these two little squeal\ning porkers into the pen. Else will\nit be the worse for thee!"\n"Give me the stick, then, Granny,"\nsaid Betty; and without remember\ning that it was a magic wand the\nold woman handed Betty the slender\nstick.\nAs soon as Betty held the magic\nwand safely in her hand she seemed\n.changed from a quiet country maiden\nInto a proud princess. She faced the\nold woman, and with a terrible look\nsaid, "Now, thou wicked witch, thou\nart about to receive punishment for\nall thy wrong-doing! Behold, I com\nmand thee to become a cross old\ncatt"\nThe old woman could not help her\nself, and so when Betty waved the\nwand there suddenly appeared in\nstead of the old woman a very ugly\nold cat, who spat and clawed about\nas if she was in a very had temper.\nThe two little pigs meanwhile\nstood perfectly still, with their eyes\nas wide open as pigs\' eyes ever are.\nAs soon as the old cat was gone\nBetty turned to them, and with a\nwave of the\' wand restored Pendra\ngon, Jr., to his true shape, and hand\ned htm the wand again.\n"I thought you would like to re\nStore your father to his own shape\nyourself," she said, "It seems more\ndutiful."\n"So it does," he replied; and in a\nmoment more the old magician stood\nbefore them well as ever.\n. "Before you go," said Betty to the\nfather and son, "I wish to give you\nboth a word of warning. To you,\nPendragon, Jr., I would say this:\nBemember to learn your business\nbefore you begin to practice it. If\nit had not been for me the old witch\nwould have succeeded in capturing\nboth your father and yourself. She\nhad been the enemy of your family\nfor many centuries, and would have\nbeen glad to ruin you both."\n"Why, was that old KlspetK, tKe\nwitch?" asked Pendragon, Sr., muolj\nsurprised,\n"Yes," said Betty. "And you would\nhave known her in a moment had\nyou not been so silly as to leave\nhome without your magic spectacles\nand your wand."\n"But I was anxious about mj; boy,"\nsaid the old magician.\n"And to whom are we Indebted\nPendragon, Jr., began, when she in\nterrupted him.\n"I," said she, "M Mania, Queen\nof the Fairies."\nAnd she vanished to the sound of\nsweet music, that grew fainter and\nfainter, and died away in the dis\ntance.
