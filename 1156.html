A. C. Hamilton Breaks All\nRecords for Parachute Leap\nFrom Airplane.\nTAKES LIFE IN HIS HANDS\nThrough Miles of Cloud Floors to the\nEarth Hanging to a Parachute\nNone the Worse for His Har-\nrowing Experience.\nNew York. All records for para\nchute drops went to smash at Carl\nStrom field when Lieut A. Q, Hamil\nton fell 20,800 feet tbrougb space In\nthe quick time of 111 minutes, better\ning hy ft least a thousand feet the\nrecord for altitude made by Lieut. Wil\nson In Texas. It might be noted, says\nAir Service news letter, that Lieut.\nHamilton Jumped ; his method of leav\ning the plane was not a "drag ofT."\nHamilton, who has bad quite a little\nexperience with parachutes, had re\nmarked upon bearing of the previously\nestablished record that he thought he\ncould better it and last Friday the at\ntempt was made. He went aloft in a\nLa Pere piloted by Lieut. P. H.\nDownes. Downes pushed on until an\naltitude Just short of 21.01)0 feet had\nbeen reached when a miss In the motor\nmade It Impossible to Continue higher.\nAt four miles above the earth the air\nwas biting cold.\nCircling about for a glimpse of\nenrth through rifts In the cloud floors,\nthe aviators described what they de\nducted to he Dorr field, nine miles\neast of Carlstrom Beld. Judging the\nspeed of the wind and Its effect on\nthe chute during the drop, Lieut.\nDownes moved west gome two miles\nand signaled for Lieut. Hamilton to\nJump.\nThe Parachute.\nRight here mention might be made\nof a circumstance which puts an added\nthrill Into parachuting at high alti\ntudes and lends Interest to the estab\nlishment of a new record. The para\nchute used by aviators Is folded snug\nly Inside a pack curried on the back.\nThe operator steps off, allows himself\na couple of seconds to fall clear of\nhis machine, then pulls a wire depend\ning over his shoulder.

Kvery one of the great\nand devoted company of chaplains in\nthe army and navy during the World\nwar, who represented the 27 Protes\ntant denominations united for service\nIn the general wartime commission,\nreceived a commemorative medallion\nrecently. This beautiful token Is In\ntended to convey In tangible form the\nmessage of grateful appreciation from\nthe churches to their chaplain sons\nwho were ready to give up everything,\neven life Itself, for their fellows light\ning on lund and sea.\nTo President Wilson went the first\none, and this was followed by presen\ntations to the secretary of war, the\naecretnry of the navy. Bishop C. H.\nBrent, chief chaplain of the A. E. F\nCM. John T Axtnn, chief chaplain of\nthe eriny. and CapL John O. r rider,\nThe Jackies are sleeping on the green, but the "green" In this case Is no\nthe lawn or meadows, but the green of a pool table for the Navy club In Ne\nYork Is crowded with visiting Jackies.\nleases a smnll pilot chute some couple\nof feet in diameter. This pilot sprlnirs\nop.-n automatically and catching the\nrush of air, draws the main chute from\nthe puck. In the top of the main\nchute is an automatic vent which,\nopening to a width of five feet when\nthe big parasol first unfolds, gives the\nair COmprCflMd within a chance to es\ncape and lessens the danger of blow\ning the chute npnrt. When the fall\nhas been checked rubber springs or\nhock-absorbers in the vent close It In\nuntil but a small hole remains. At\nthe atmosphere pressure wherein most\nparachute drops from ordinary alti\ntudes are made the speed attained bv\nthe operator In his couple of seconds\nfall is sufficient to create enough pres\nsure under the pilot chute to cause It\nwhen released to yank the big one\nat once from its pack. Usually the op\nerator Is descending at normal speed\nafter falling less than 200 feet.\nThrough Space.\nUpon receiving his pilot\'s Signal,\nHamilton climbed to the edge of the\nCockpit, waved his hand anil dropped\nInto space. After the usual Interval\nhe pulled his release cord but Instead\nof having his drop immediately check\ned, he fell a distance which was esti\nmated by both him and Lieut. Downes\nto be 2.000 feet before his parachute\nsnapped out and opened with a loud\nreport. Looking aloft he saw that the\nchief of the chaplain\'s corps of the\nnavy.\nSymbolizes Service.\nThis medallion is of bronze, 2\nInches In diameter. It Is the realiza\ntion of a suggestion made soon after\nthe armistice to the executive commit\ntee of the general war-time CO ds-\nslon of the churches. The committee\napproved the proposal and made It one\nof the tasks committed to the general\ncommittee on army and navy chaplain!\nwhen the general war-time commission\ndissolved. The design Is by Mrs. Laura\nGardln Eraser of New York, one of\nthe best-known of American medalists.\nThe task given to Mrs. Eraser was to\nproduce a design expressing the spirit\nof the men who served as chaplnlns,\nwhich would represent both brunches\nof the service.\nOne side commemorates In symbol\nthe service of the army chaplain, and\nthe other side the navy chaplain. In\nshowing his service In the urmy a\nchaplain Is presented In the act of\nministering to B wounded soldier. In\nthe center of the design the gas mask\nIs seen ready for Immediate adjust\nment. The suggestion Is that the chap\nlain has removed It the better to suc\ncor the wounded mnn. Strength and\nsympathy are expressed In the finely\nmodeled figure. The stricken soldier\nrepresents nn artilleryman serving the\nbig guns, Stripped to the waist.\nOn the reverse side \'he :lne record\nsprings which close the vent were\nbroken. The chute Is of n size deslgn\n1 ed to enable a man to reach the ground\nas quickly as Is consistent with safety\n) In landing and the shock upon totleh-\nIng earth is always severe. With the\ni vent wide open the best Hamlltiyi\ncould hope for was a few broken\nhones.\nTo add to his dismay he found upon\npiercing the lowest layer of clouds\nthat Carlstrom Held had been mistaken\nfor Dorr and that Instead o drifting\ntoward the former he was due to land\n1 In the timber between there and the\ntown of Arcadia, with good prospects\nof serious Injury to himself. Almost\nbelow rtlm he discerned the outlines\nof Joshua creek and to prevent his\ndrifting past tills he devoted all his\nenergies. \'"limbing the rigging to\nwindward he managed to pull the edge\ndown and created n planing effect\ni which held him pretty well Into the\n! wind. By the best of luck he dropped\nbetween the overhanging branches on\neither side of the creek and was saved\na crush against Its bed by the cush\nioning action of the parachute, which\nhad became entangled in the branches\nof the tree. It took him a quarter of\nan hour to extricate himself from a\nj mass of tangled cordage and two hours\nfor u searching party to discover him\nnone the worse for a somewhat bar-\n\' rowing experience.\nin Cleveland\ndecorated streets of Cleveland, during\nof the mej who served as chaplains In\nthe navy is symbolised by the repre\nsentation of a battleship, with the\ncross as the central feature, and the\ninscription at the top, "Awarded to the\nChaplains of the American Army and\nNavy."
