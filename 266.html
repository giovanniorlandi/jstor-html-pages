I, used many kinds of patent medicines, before trying the Cuticura Remedies, ?, all to no avail., "A friend teased me to try Cuticura., At last I consented, when my boy, was three years and four months, old, having had eczema all that time,, and suffering untold misery.

A, genuine friend would not permit a lit, tle matter of pride to prevent the peo, ple from being properly represented at, Washington., As a matter of fact, however, the, question as to whose name thisdelegate, bill shall carry, is rather a small one., It will not be such an enduring piece, of legislation as will bring fame, even, in Alaska, to ai.j mac. Except as a, ?t?p in the conte t for self-government, it is not of very great consequence. It, is of vital importance just at this time,, of course, because of its relation to, that all-consuming, but necessarily, transitory, contest. When self-govern, ment shall have been secured the dele, gate bill, as one of the incidents of the, struggle in securing it, will be cver, shadoved by the anal result to such an, extent that those who have fought for, it as a panacea in itself for Alaskan, ills will be forgotten,, At the city election held last week In, Seattle the republicans elected their, entire ticket except the mayor and two, councilmen. Most of the candidates of, that party received handsome plurali, ties. There were some close contests, tor ward councilmen and one of the can, didates of the municipalowncrship par, ty for counciiman-at-large came within, 3.70 votes of election.

PrnLKY, | Register,, The Children Enjoy, Life out of doors and out of the games which they play and the enjoyment, which they receive and the efforts which they make, comes the greater part of that, healthful development which is so essential to their happiness when grown. \'When, a laxative is needed the remedy which is given to them to cleanse and sweeten and, strengthen the internal organs on which it acts, should be such as physicians would, sanction, because its component parts are known to be wholesome and the remedy, itself free from every objectionable quality. The one remedy which physicians and, parents, well-informed, approve and recommend and which the little ones enjoy,, because of its pleasant flavor, its gentle action and its beneficial effects, is? Syrup, of Figs? and for the same reason it is the only laxative which should be used by, fathers and mothers., Syrup of Figs is the only remedy which acts gently, pleasantly and naturally, without griping, irritating, or nauseating and which cleanses the system effectually,, without producing that constipated habit which results from the use of the old, time cathartics and modern imitations, and against which the children should be so, carefully guarded. If you would have them grow to manhood and womanhood,, strong, healthy and happy, do not give them medicines, when medicines are not, needed, and when nature needs assistance in the way of a laxative, give them only, the simple, pleasant and gentle? Syrup of Figs., Its quality is due not only to the excellence of the combination of the laxative, principles of plants with pleasant aromatic syrups and juices, but also to our, original method of manufacture and as you value the health of the little ones, do, not accept any of the substitutes which unscrupulous dealers sometimes offer to, increase their profits. Please to remember, the full name of the Company ?, CALIFORNIA FIG SYRUP CO.? is printed on the front of every package.
