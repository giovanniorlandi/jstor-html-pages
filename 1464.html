Henderson Martin made\nBraves Smothered by Lighter\nOpponents Resort to Rough\nStuff.\nThe football game Saturday\nbetween the Haskel Reserves\nand Wentworth resulted in a\none-sided score of ?2 0 in favor\nof the cadets. Haskell made\npretty gains but lacked a punch\nwhen a punch was needed to get\nresults. They gave too much at\ntention to rough stuff to accom\nplish much in a legitimate way,\nespecially in the second half\nwhen they were made to realize\nthat the cadets were their mas\nters at the game.\nThe game started when Has\nkell lifted the oval far down the\nfield into Wentworth territory.\nIt was returned nearly to the\ncenter of the field before being\ndowned. Haskell was playing\noff side which aided the cadets\nvery materially in making the\nfirst touchdown . in about two\nminutes of play. Chapin kicked\ngoal. The second touchdown was\nmade through the air, Harrison\nto Byler. The third, in the same\nhalf, came about when Simmons\nintercepted one of Haskell\'s at\ntempted flights, and ran sixty\nfive yards before landing. Hall\nplunged the remaining distance,\nmaking the score at the close of\nthe first half, 20 to 0.\nTwelve more points were add\ned in the second half, principally\nthrough the stellar work of Sim\nmons, Hall, Byler and Zelleken.\nHaskell made some pretty gains\nin this half, but were always\nsmothered when they became\ntoo dangerous.

Coal miners\nand coal operators in the Southwest\nern district, composed of Missouri,\nKansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas,\nsame to an agreement on their wage\nscale last night after two weeks of ne\ngotiations here and signed new con\ntracts. The miners will go back to\nwork immediately, pending approval\nA the contract signed, by the fuel ad\nministration. The new contract pro\nvides for a wage increase of from CO\nto 80 cents a ton for coal mined and a\nmodification of the penalty clause.\nThe clause in the contract providing\nfor the automatic collection of penal\nties, which has been the stumbling\nblock throughout the entire negotia\ntions, was compromised by both sides\nadopting a clause providing for an im\nmediate hearing, in case of shutdown,\nbefore the automatic penalty shall ac\ncrue, the hearing to be held within\ntwenty days. According to W. L. A.\nJohnson, general commissioner of the\nSouthwestern Operators\' Association,\nthis cures the evil complained of by\nthe operators and is satisfactory to the\nnitiers.\nJohn Wilkinson, president of the\nUnited Mine Workers In district No.\n21, said he was well satisfied with the\nigreement and contract and was going\nhome to see that It was enforced. Mr.\nWilkinson left for McAlester, Ok., last\nnight to call a meeting of the Inde-\npendent Mine Operators\' Association\ni here with a view to getting them to\nndorse the contract.\nOfficials of the operators\' associa\ntion said last night that this contract\nis a . supplemental one and can be\ncome effective only after approval by\nDr. Garfield of the coal administration.\nThe wage increase means to the oper\nators a corresponding increase in the\nselling price of coal sufficient to cover\nthe additional expense to the opera\ntors. They are preparing a cost data\nto submit to lr. Garfield showing the\ntctual increase in wages and asking\n!iis approval. Mr. Johnson said the\nal in the Southwest Is. in thin veins\nind the overhead expense Is greater\n.nan in other districts in the United\nStates. The margin of profit is small\nand a wage increase must result in an\nincreased selling price in order " to\nbreak even.\nIMPORTS HAVE INCREASED\nLast Year $1,100,000,000 Worth of Raw\nMaterials Abroad Came Into\nThis Country.\nWashington, Oct. 24.

C\nLiberty Loan Bonds What\nThey Are and How Obtained\nThe bonds of the second Issue of the Liberty Loan are to be Issued\nunder the act of Congress approved by the President September\n24. 1917.\nThe amount of the issue will be $3,000,000,000 or more;\n$3,000,000,000 will be offered, and the right is reserved to allot bonds\nin excess of that amount to the extent of one-half of the oversub\nscription. That is, if $5,000,000,000 is subscribed the right is reserved\nto issue $1,000,000,000 more than the $3,000,000,000-\nThe bonds will be offered for sale on October 1, 1917, and sub\nscriptions will be received until the close of the business day of\nOctober 27.\nThe bonds will bear date November 15. 1917, and will mature\nNovember 15, 1942. But the Government reserves the right to call\nin and pay the bonds In full, with accrued interest, any time after\n10 years after their date.\nk is believed that the second Liberty Loan, like the first Issue\nof Liberty Loan Bonds, will be heavily oversubscribed, but no matter\nhow largely oversubscribed, the policy of distributing these bonds\nas widely as possible among the people of the country will be followed,\nand every subscriber to an amount not greater than $1,000 is sure\nto receive the bond or bonds subscribed for.\nSubscribers to larger amounts will receive an allotment based .\non the amount of the bond issue and Its proportion to the amount\nof subscription. What proportion of t heir subscription they will\nobtain will not be known until all subscriptions are in.\nThe main differences between the bonds of the first Issue and\nthe bonds of the second issue of the Liberty Loan are (1) they\nrun for only 25 years instead of 30, and may be redeemed by the\nGovernment in 10 years after date instead of 15; (2) they bear 4\nper cent Interest Instead of 3V4 per cent; (3) they are liable to sur\ntaxes and excess-profits and war-profits taxes (except as to the in\nterest on $5,000 in the hands of any holder); (4) allotment may be\nmade to the extent of half of the oversubscription; and (5) the in\nstallment plan of payment is slightly different.\nThe bonds are convertible gold bonds and bear 4 per cent annual\ninterest, the interest being payable semiannually on May 15 and No\nvember 15 of each year.\nThe bonds are exempt, both as to principal and interest, from\nall taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States, any\nstate, or any other possessions of the I\'nited States or by any local\ntaxing authority, except (a) estate or inheritance taxes, him! (b) grad\nuated additional income taxes, commonly known as surtaxes, and\nexcess-profits and war-profits taxes now or hereafter imposed. They\nare not liable- to the ordinary Federal income tax.\nThe interest on an amount of bonds the principal of which dies\nnot exceed $5,000, owned by any individual, partnership, association\nor corporation, are exempted from the taxes provided for In clause\n(b) above.\nThe right is given to holders of the bonds to exchange them for\nbonds bearing a higher rate of interest if any such shall later be\nIssued by the United States before the termination of the war. This\nconversion privilege must be exercised, if at all, within six mouths\nafter the issuance of such higher-rate bonds.\nThe second Issue of Liberty Loan Bonds will be of two kinds,\nregistered and coupon\nThe registered bonds will be registered at the Treasury In the\nname of their owners and will be or the denominations of $50, .$100\n$500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 and $200,000. Checks for the interest on\ntheBU bonds will be mailed from the Treasury to the owners each\naeruUnnuul interest date.\nThe ooupon bonds will be payable to bearer and w ill have coupons\nattached for the Interest. They wil! be In denominations or $50, $100,\n$500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000. The coupons can be c ashed like a\nGovernment check at any bank.\nThe coupon bonds of this loan will have only four coupons at\ntached, representing the semiannual interest for two years. Between\nNovember 15, 1919, and May 15. 1920, the holders of coupon bonds\nmust exchange their bonds for new bonds having full sets of coupons\nTbete temporary bonds are ipsued because the work or engraving so\nmuny bonds with so large a number of coupons attached cannot be\ncompleted within a reasonable time for delivery.\nBonds of the second Liberty Loan can be purchased by hilins\nout an application blank made on the form prescribed by the Secre\ntary of the Treasury, which can be obtained rrotu any bank or Liberty\nLoan committee, and sending it or having it sent u the Treasury ot\nthe United Slates or any Federal Reserve bank or branch, accom\npanied by the payment of per cent of the amount of bonds ap\nplied for.\nThese applications must reach the Treasury Department, a Fed\neral Reserve bank or branch thereof, or some incorporated or trust\ncompany In the United States, on or before the cIo.m; of business\nOctober 27, 1917. Practically every bank in the United States win\nwillingly receive these applications and handle the whole transaction\nof the purchase of bonds for any subscriber.\nA purchaser may pay in full for his bonds at the time of making\nbis application or, if he so prefers, he can take advantage of the \'\nInstallment plan and pay 2 per cent on application, 18 per cent on\nNovember 15, 1917, 40 per cent on December 15, 1917. and the re\nmalning 40 per cent on January 15, 191S.\nAlthough so far as the Government is concerned the purchase\nprice for the bonds must be paid as above, nearly every bank In the\ncountry will make arrangements by which Liberty Loan Bonds can\nbe paid on an Installment plan providing for weekly or monthly pay\nments, and a Rieat many emplojers will make the same arrangements\nfor their employes.\nPayment can be made to the Treasury Department or to any on,\nof the Federal Reserve banks, but purchasers are ur-ed to make their\npayments to the banks or other agencies wiib waom Uuy placed\ntheir subscriptions. \' N\nsoil is in better shape for work\ning and for growing plants..\nEarly vegetables planted in the\nfall plowed garden will make a\nquick start, for the organic mat\nter will have partially decayed\nand become well incorporated hi\nthe soil during the winter.

Do You?\nNO man is too busy, no man\'s time so precious, that he\ncannot afford to spend a small part of one day in\nseven in the house of God.\nDon\'t lie in bed on the Sabbath morn. The church\nservices are not at an early hour. Six days in the week\na man will rush for the office to be in time for business.\nThat is all right. He should be prompt in his business\nduties. He should also be prompt in his business with God.\nIt is true that this is a rush age. But the biggest men in\nthe country, the men whose services are worth as much\nin an hour as the ordinary man\'s are in a day, may be\nseen for an hour and more every Sabbath in church. These\nmen find time to GO TO CHURCH. They realize the\nseriousness of their obligation. They are not shirkers.\nThey do not consider it a sign of weakness to be seen in\nchurch. They want to be seen there. All honor to these\nmen.\nWhen you hear a man say that he is too busy to GO\nTO CHURCH reason with him, recall to him that the\nbusiest men in the country manage to find time for divine\nworship. ..If you are - healthy and prosperous, GO TO\nCHURCH and thank God for His blessings. .If you are\nill and in want, GO TO CHURCH and pray to God that\nyour condition may be improved. .And that reminds us\nhow ready some people are to forget God and His blessings\nwhen things are coming their way. It is only when mis\nfortune comes that they turn to God and the churches.\nThen they need God and the consolation that the church\naffords.\nBut, while God is merciful, he also is just. If when\npeople are prosperous and happy, they do not find time\nto visit the house of God, it is not just that God should\npour out his blessings and graces to them when misfortune\ncomes.\nDon\'t make the specious plea that you\'re to busy to\nGO TO CHURCH.\nGO TO CHURCH next Sunday and every Sunday.\nServices at Lexington Churches\ni\nMethodist Episcopal Church.\nSunday School at 9:30 a. m.\nMorning service at 11:00 a. m.\nPresbyterian Church.\nSabbath School at 9:30 a. m.\nPreaching services at 11:00 a.\nEpworth League at 6 :30 p. m. ; m., and 7 :30 p. m.
