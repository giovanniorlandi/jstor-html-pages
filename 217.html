        <pre>["Introduction\nSince time immemorial, plants containing beneficial\nand medicinal properties have been known and used by\nhuman beings in some form or other (Jain and Saklani\n1991). In developing countries, 80% of the population\nstill use traditional folk medicines obtained from natural\nresources (Farnsworth et al 1985). In India, with\nmore than 75% of the population residing in rural\nareas (Anonymous 1991) close to natural resources,\nrich traditions of utilizing medicinal plants have existed\namong indigenous peoples for ages. Particularly in the\nHimalayan region of the country, traditions of using\nmedicinal plants and other biological resources in a\nvariety of ways are directly linked to the cultural milieu.\nMoreover, the communities in the region have conserved\nthese natural resources by using their indige-\nnous skills (Panwar, unpublished data). The ethics and\nthe mythology of the Himalayan region are linked to\nplants, animals, and the immediate environment. These\ncomponents of the natural world have a place in the\nsociocultural and religious activities of Himalayan communities,\nwho worship them in the form of various\ngods, goddesses, and minor deities. Thus, local attitudes\nhave long helped the conservation of natural\nresources in this region.\nOwing to the great diversity of their ecosystems, the\nHimalayas act as a storehouse for a whole range of\nmedicinal plants. It is recorded that about 30% of the\nendemic species of the Indian subcontinent are found\nin the Himalayas, most of which are collected at high\naltitudes (Farooquee and Saxena 1996). The Nanda\nDevi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in the western\nHimalayas is one such diverse ecosystem, and it harbors\na wide range of medicinal plants (Hajra and Balodi\n1995; Samant et al 1996).\nThe present paper attempts to explore the potential\nof the much advocated community-based approach\nto resource conservation (McNeely et al 1990; Gadgil\n1991; UNCED 1993) practiced by the Bhotiya tribe in\nNDBR. This is based on the belief that indigenous communities\nhave evolved traditional wisdom about\nresource conservation over the centuries (Gadgil 1992).\nThis paper focuses on the cultivation of medicinal\nplants as practiced by the Bhotiya and on the economics\nof this practice in the 5 villages of the Pithoragarh District\nin the buffer zone of NDBR. It also attempts to\nexplore the prospects of medicinal plant cultivation as a\npotential economic venture in the region and a way of\nensuring the long-term conservation of these herbs in\nthe wild.\nStudy area\nGeographical location and climate\nThe Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve was officially designated\nin 1988 to conserve valuable Himalayan flora and\nfauna. Geographically, NDBR is situated between 79°40'\nand 80°5'E longitude and 30°17' and 30°41'N latitude\n(Figure 1). It spreads over an area of 2236.74 km2\nacross three districts—Chamoli, Almora, and Pithoragarh—in\nthe state of Uttar Pradesh in northwestern\nIndia. The reserve has 2 distinct zones: an inner core\nzone of 625.42 km2 and, encircling this, an outer buffer\nzone of 1611.12 km2. The Indian government already\ndesignated the core zone of NDBR as Nanda Devi\n272\nMedicinal Plant Cultivation and Sustainable Development\nA Case Study in the Buffer Zone of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, Western Himalaya, India\nChandra Shekhar Silori and Ruchi Badola\nThe Nanda Devi Biosphere\nReserve\n(NDBR) in the western\nHimalaya has a high\nlevel of biological and\ncultural diversity. The\nBhotiya community,\nwhose livelihood is\nhighly dependent on\nlocal natural\nresources, inhabits the\nbuffer zone of NDBR. Bhotiya practice seasonal and altitudinal\nmigration and stay inside the buffer zone of\nNDBR for only 6 months (May–October). A survey was\nconducted in 1996 in 5 villages in Pithoragarh District of\nthe buffer zone, where Bhotiya cultivate medicinal plants\non their agriculture fields. The aim of the survey was to\nunderstand the socioeconomics of medicinal plant cultivation\nand evaluate the future prospects of this practice\nin promoting sustainable development among the local\ncommunity. Of a total of 71 families, 90% cultivated\nmedicinal plants on 78% of the total reported cultivated\narea (15.29 ha). At the time of the survey, a total of 12\nspecies of medicinal plants were under cultivation, of\nwhich 6 were being marketed while the remaining 6 were\nstill under nursery plantation for future propagation. On\naverage, a family earns about Rs.2423 ± 376.95 per\nseason from the sale of medicinal plants (Rs.38 = US$1\nin 1996). Based on the average productivity (kg/ha/y),\nwe estimated that an average family could earn between\nRs.4362 and Rs.86,500 from the sale of medicinal\nherbs. Encouragement of medicinal plant cultivation at\nhigh altitudes in the Himalayas would help to generate\nbetter monetary returns as well as conserve these herbs\nin the wild and preserve traditional ethnomedicinal\nknowledge among local people.\nKeywords: Biosphere reserve; biodiversity; medicinal\nplants; indigenous knowledge; mountain rural economy;\nNanda Devi; Himalaya; India.\nPeer reviewed: March 2000.

The reserve was\nnamed after the Nanda Devi west peak (7817 m), located\nwithin the core zone. \nThe entire area is characterized by distinctive\nmicroclimates. The annual approximate variation in\nprecipitation ranges from 750 to 2000 mm, while the\ntemperature varies from below 0°C (December–January)\nto 35°C (June–July) (Silori and Badola 1999). The\nrainfall gradient decreases from south to north; therefore,\nthe northern valleys of the Dhauli Ganga and\nGirthi Ganga rivers are comparatively dry, characterized\nby a trans-Himalayan climate with stunted and sparse\nscrub vegetation. The upper portion of the reserve (at\nelevations above 4500 m) remains snow covered\nthroughout the year. Thus, about 81% of the core zone\nand 60% of the buffer zone remain snow covered\nthroughout the year (Sahai and Kimothi 1996). \nBiological diversity \nGreat altitudinal variation (1800–7817 m) and the varied\ntopography of the area support a vast range of bio-\nlogical diversity in the entire biosphere reserve. Due to\nrich biological and cultural diversity, NDBR was also\ndeclared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.\nAccording to a remote sensing study by Sahai and\nKimothi (1996), 66% of the total area of the NDBR is\nsnow bound or covered by glaciers throughout the year.\nThe vegetative cover of the reserve spreads over 22.2%\nof its total area; 6.6% is wasteland and 4.5% is grasslands\nor alpine pastures, known locally as bugyal. Only\n0.7% of the NDBR is developed or under agriculture.\nOf the total forest cover, about 47% is dense forests\n(>40% crown cover), 35% open (10–40% crown cover),\nand 18% miscellaneous and degraded forests (<10%\ncrown cover). So far, a total of 793 plant species have\nbeen recorded in the entire biosphere reserve (Hajra\nand Balodi 1995). The major forest types at the lower\naltitudes (between 1800 and 3000 m) are Himalayan\nmoist/dry temperate forest with oak (Quercus semecarpifolia),\ndeodar (Cedrus deodara), blue pine (Pinus wallichi-\nana), and other coniferous species. Above 3000 m,\nalong the altitudinal gradient, the tree vegetation comprised\nof subalpine and alpine forest types is dominated\nby firs (Abies pindrow) and junipers (Juniperus communis),\nwhile birch (Betula utilis) in association with rho-\ndodendron (Rhododendron campanulatum) forms the timber\nline around 3600–3800 m (Champion and Seth\n1968). The shrub species Prinsepia utilis, Berberis aristata,\nRosa macrophylla, and Rosa webbiana dominate the\nunderstorey vegetation. In alpine meadows above the\ntimberline (Figure 2), which remain snow free for\nabout 4–5 months of the year (June–October), varieties\nof flowering plants of species such as Primula, Potentilla¸\nAnemone, Geranium, Pedicularis, and Saussarea abound.\nThe entire reserve is a storehouse for several ethnobotanical\nspecies, including medicinal plants. Silori\nand Badola (1999) have listed a total of 101 species of\nplants found in the entire buffer zone of NDBR that are\nused by the villagers for various purposes. These\ninclude fibers used as a source of food or medicine,\nagricultural implements, timber, firewood, and herbs\nthat have religious significance. Of these, the local people\nuse 27 species as medicinal herbs.\nSociocultural milieu\nThere is a high level of ethnic diversity throughout the\nNanda Devi region. Human habitation is limited in\nthe 19 villages in the buffer zone (Figure 1). The\nBhotiya, a tribal community, dominate the human population.\nTraditionally, the cross-border trade with\nTibet was the main source of income for the Bhotiya\nbefore it was banned in 1962 after the Indo-Chinese\nwar. Adventure tourism to Nanda Devi peak emerged\nas a popular alternative source of income for the villagers,\nespecially those residing in the part of Chamoli\nDistrict in the buffer zone. But in view of the potential\nloss of biodiversity due to lack of control over this\nform of tourism, it was banned by governmental decision\nin 1982. The consecutive loss of major sources of\nincome forced the Bhotiya to look for alternatives.\n273\nResearch\nFIGURE 1 Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR, Government of India\nNotification no. 1/6/80-ND under UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere Programme)\nin the western Himalaya, India, showing the locations of the 5 vil-\nlages surveyed in the Pithoragarh District in the buffer zone. Nanda Devi\nNational Park was created by the Government of India through its Notification\nno. 3912/14-3-35-80 of 6 September 1982, which included a ban on\ntourism activities. NDBR was created in 1988.\n', 'Mountain Research and Development   Vol 20   No 3   Aug 2000\nRecently, rearing sheep and goats, practicing agriculture\non marginal lands, and the production and sale\nof woolen articles have been major occupations among\nthe Bhotiya.\nMethods\nThe questionnaire survey method was employed to collect\ninformation on the cultivation and economics of\nmedicinal plants. Extensive surveys at the household\nlevel were conducted in 5 villages in Pithoragarh District,\nthat is, Martoli, Mapa, Pachhu, Ganaghar, and Mil-\nam (Figure 1). All the households in the villages surveyed\nwere interviewed to collect information on vari-\nous aspects of medicinal plant cultivation, harvest\nseason, yield, and marketing options. Interviewing the\nhead of each family, we also collected data on the average\nannual income per family from other sources, such\nas agriculture, dealings in woolen articles, and rearing\nof sheep and goats. Since the Bhotiya stay for 6 months\nin these villages (May–October), the information was\ncollected during this period in 1996. We also recorded\nthe perception of the villagers regarding the constraints\nthey face in the cultivation and marketing of medicinal\nplants and possible measures to make the venture more\nviable in both economic and ecological terms.\nResults\nSocioeconomic features of the villages surveyed\nAll 5 villages are located in remote valleys at altitudes\nabove 3000 m (Table 1). The villages are inhabited by\nthe Johari, a subgroup of the Bhotiya community; therefore,\nthe entire valley of the Gori Ganga River is also\nknown as the Johar Valley. All the villages are accessible\nafter a tough hilly trek of at least 35 km and up to a\nmaximum of 55 km, from motorable roads across and\nalong the contours at high altitudes.\nThe Bhotiya practice seasonal migration, moving to\nthe lower altitudes outside the buffer zone during the\nsevere winter months (November–April), while they\nspend the summer months (May–October) inside the\nbuffer zone. However, over the decades, migration has\nundergone major transformation. The number of\nmigrating families has declined every year ever since\nthe ban on cross-border trade was imposed (Prasad\n1989). Migrants are generally the older people in the\nfamilies; the younger members stay back to continue\ntheir schooling or jobs in the lower plains. As a result,\nthe average size of the migrant family recorded was\napproximately 2 people. Historically, Milam village,\nwith more than 600 families, used to be the largest center\nin the cross-border trade. But during the survey, we\n274\nChandra Shekhar Silori and Ruchi Badola\nFIGURE 2 Alpine meadows\nabove the timberline contain a\ngreat variety of flowering\nplants, including medicinal\nherbs. (Photo by C. S. Silori)\n', 'enumerated only 18 families from this village. The lack\nof alternative employment opportunities following the\nban forced the people to migrate to the lower plains, a\ncommon phenomenon throughout the Himalayan\nregion (Farooquee 1994; Hoon 1996). \nOf the 71 families surveyed in the villages, 69%\nowned a livestock population totaling 2520 head (Table\n1). Of this, 66% were sheep, 27% goats, and 4% cattle,\nwhile the remaining 3% were mules used for carrying\nloads during seasonal migration. On average, each family\nowned between 12 and 62 head of livestock. Ninety-\nseven percent of the families were landowners. Of\nthese, 81% were marginal farmers with 1 ha of land,\n18% were small farmers with 2 ha of land, and the\nremaining 1% were small- to medium-scale farmers with\n2–4 ha of agricultural land. Of the total agricultural\narea, according to government records (123.87 ha),\nonly 12% was recorded under cultivation during the\nhousehold survey. This is due to the declining number\nof migrating families, which results in most of the area\nremaining uncultivated. Besides medicinal herbs, traditional\ncrops (some introduced in the early 19th centu-\nry) such as oagal (Fagopyrum esculentum) and phaphar\n(Fagopyrum tartaricum)—two species of buckwheat—uwa\nor barley (Hordeum vulgare), amaranth (Amaranthus frumentaceous),\nrajma, or kidney beans (Phaseolus spp), and\npotato (Solanum tuberosum) are also grown.\nThe study showed that the following areas were the\nmajor sources of overall income: agricultural produce\n(3–21%), medicinal herbs (5–10%), woolen products\n(24–53%), and the sale of sheep and goats (35–60%)\n(Table 2). The overall income from sheep and goats\nranged between 72 and 89%, indicating the role of\nthese animals in the economy of the villages surveyed.\nCultivation practices to produce medicinal plants\nThe cultivation of medicinal plants is in fact not a new\npractice in the villages studied.

During the household survey and field\nobservations, it was recorded that villagers cultivated a\ntotal of 12 species of medicinal plants (Table 3). Of\nthese, one was rare (Allium wallichii) and one endangered\n(Saussurea costus), while two others (Nardostachys\ngrandiflora and Picrorhiza kurrooa) are listed as vulnerable\nin the Red Data Book of Indian Plants (Nair and\nSastry 1990). The roots of 8 species are used for medicinal\npurposes; therefore, the fresh roots of these species\nare dug up at the end of every season (October) while\nthe old roots are left for propagation. The maximum\nproductivity per unit area was recorded for Gandrayan\nor Angelica glauca (593/kg/ha/y), while the minimum\nwas recorded for Pharan or Allium carolinianum\n(79/kg/ha/y)  (Table 4). \nMarketing of medicinal plants\nAt the time of the study, of the 12 cultivated species, 6\nwere being marketed by the villages surveyed while the\nremaining 6 were still under nursery plantation to prepare\nseeds, rhizomes, or bulbs for propagation. Of the\ntotal cultivated area under medicinal herbs (11.93 ha),\nJambu (Allium wallichii) and Pharan (Allium\ncarolinianum) together occupied about 35%, while Kala\nJeera (Carum carvi, 18%), Gandrayan (Angelica glauca,\n15%), and Koot (Saussurea costus, 11%) were other\nimportant species (Table 4). The Bhotiya sell these\nherbs or exchange them for grains and other spices at\nthe lower altitudes in the foothills of the Himalayas. \nThe marketing of medicinal herbs by the villagers is\ngenerally done through middlemen, who visit these villages\nat harvest time (September–October). The prices\nof medicinal herbs fluctuated between Rs.30 and Rs.600\nper kg during the study period (1996). It was calculated\nthat, on average, a family earns about Rs.2423 ± 376.95\nper season from the sale of medicinal herbs. The range\nof total earnings per family varied from Rs.200 to\nRs.23,000 during 1996. The great variation in earnings\nfrom the sale of medicinal herbs is mainly due to variation\nin the area under cultivation and also to the type\nof species grown. Based on the average productivity of\nmedicinal herbs in the study villages and on their\nprices, we estimated that one family could earn between\nRs.4362 and Rs86,500 from 1 ha of agricultural land per\nseason, depending on the choice of the medicinal herb\nto be cultivated (Table 4). Compared with traditional\ncash crops, such as potato, rajma (beans), and amaranth,\nthe income from medicinal plants is quite high.\nThe selling price of these traditional cash crops at the\ntime of the survey in the villages studied was recorded\nas Rs.4, Rs18, and Rs.11 per kg, respectively, for potato,\nrajma, and amaranth, which is much lower than the lowest\nselling price of medicinal plants.\nDiscussion\nThe designation of Nanda Devi National Park (the core\nzone of NDBR) in 1982 and the creation of the biosphere\nreserve in 1988 imposed a ban on the collection\nof medicinal plants from the region. Therefore, to meet\ntheir own need for medicinal herbs in the absence of\nmedical facilities in remote villages and to fulfill the\ngrowing demand for these herbs on the open market,\nthe villagers began to cultivate them on their agricultur277\nResearch\naThe productivity of these herbs could not be assessed since they were still under nursery plantation and were not yet ready for harvest.\nbMedicinal herbs marketed at the time of the survey.\nArea (ha) under Average productivity Market rate Projected\nScientific name cultivation (kg/ha ± SE) (Rs/kg) cost (Rs/ha)\nAconitum heterophyllum Stapf.a 0.57 — 250 —\nAllium carolinianum Kunthb 1.82 79.3 ± 41.4 55 4362\nAllium wallichii Bakerb 2.31 102.8 ± 36.5 55 5654\nAngelica glauca Edgewb 1.78 593.3 ± 122.3 80 47,464\nCarum carvi Linnb 2.14 266.2 ± 61.3 200 53,240\nDactylorhiza hatagirea (D.Don) Soob 0.37 144.3 ± 51.7 600 86,580\nNardostachys grandiflora DC.a 0.15 — 30 —\nPicrorhiza kurrooa Royle ex Benth.a 0.64 — 250 —\nPleurospermum angelicoides (DC.)

In addition, the lack of alternate employment\nopportunities, especially after the ban on cross-border\ntrade in the early 1960s, and the changing concept of\nprotected area management focusing on people’s participation\nencouraged the Bhotiya to expand their activi-\nties. The net result of all these developments was a shift\nin the cropping pattern toward cultivation of medicinal\nherbs, largely due to the greater economic returns they\nbrought by comparison with traditional cash crops such\nas potato, rajma, and amaranth.\nThese developments in the villages surveyed may be\nconsidered positive, both from an ecological and a\nsocioeconomic point of view. As mentioned above, it\nhas been established that the sale of medicinal herbs\nfetches more money than the sale of traditional cash\ncrops. At the same time, medicinal plant cultivation has\nalso helped to conserve indigenous knowledge about\nmedicinal herbs among the Bhotiya, an important\naspect of community-based resource conservation (Battisse\n1982; Gadgil 1991; McNeely 1997; Dhar et al 1999;\nDobhal 1999). Ecologically, cultivation of medicinal\nherbs is an incentive to reduce human pressure on the\nhigh-altitude forests, providing enough time for these\nforests to regenerate after severe degradation due to\nanthropogenic impacts in the recent past (Babu et al\n1984; Moench 1989; Zhou 1993; Rao and Saxena 1994;\nFarooquee and Saxena 1996; Kala et al 1997; Maikhuri\net al 1998a,b). Nevertheless, in view of the increasing\ndemand for medicinal herbs in the near future, it will\nbe necessary to organize current cultivation practices\nand improve them by using more technical and scientific\ninputs. The local villagers also felt that the absence of\nproper marketing strategies was an obstacle to obtaining\nthe right price for their produce.\nMaikhuri et al (1998a) have projected that the productivity\nof medicinal herbs could be substantially\nincreased by more advanced techniques and proper\nmanagement. The authors projected the productivity of\nAngelica glauca at 985 kg/ha/y in the western part of\nNDBR, compared with our findings of 593 kg/ha/y.\nSimilarly, the productivity of Dactylorhiza hatagirea was\nprojected at 450 kg/ha/y, as against 144 kg/ha/y\nrecorded in our study. The projected productivity figures\nby Maikhuri et al (1998a) further elucidate the\npotential for greater economic returns from the cultivation\nof medicinal herbs in the study region under prop-\ner management.\nThere are enormous variations in the selling price\nof medicinal plants throughout the Himalayan region.\nFor example, the roots of Dactylorhiza hatagirea are sold\nfor prices from Rs.200 to Rs.1200 per kg, while the\nprice of Aconitum heterophyllum can vary from Rs.160 to\nRs.1000 per kg (Gupta et al 1998). These variations may\nbe attributed to the absence of a proper marketing system\nand the increased role of middlemen in the busi-\nness (Farooquee 1994; Gupta et al 1998). As far as economic\nreturns are concerned, Nautiyal (1996) estimat-\ned an average annual income of Rs.7150 to\nRs.55,000/ha/y, Maikhuri et al (1998a) projected earnings\nbetween Rs.12,750 and Rs.40,000/ha/y, while Rao\nand Saxena (1994) recorded earnings of\nRs.12,000/ha/y in a mixed cropping system to produce\nmedicinal herbs. From these studies, it can be concluded\nthat potential average income from cultivating\nmedicinal herbs is greater than from cultivating traditional\ncrops. The findings of our study regarding\nincome from the sale of medicinal plants support this\nconclusion.\nAlthough domestication of medicinal herbs constitutes\na potential component of sustainable rural devel-\nopment in the villages surveyed, it is highly likely that\nthe increased involvement of middlemen and contractors\nin this trade will exclude the Bhotiya from the main\ntrade. The trade therefore needs to be organized properly.\nPerhaps a highly cooperative culture, in which\nlocal people have an adequate stake, can be developed\nto provide the necessary benefits to the medicinal herb\ngrowers. Recommendations along these lines that could\nbe feasibly implemented have already been advanced\n(Kala 1998), and the success story of the world-famous\nChipko Movement—with one initiative launched by the\ninhabitants (mainly women) of the village of Reni in\nNDBR—shows how a participatory approach can work.\nHowever, more field work and research are needed on\nthese aspects in the area.\nThus, in the wake of growing commercialization,\nwhich has brought substantial changes in the traditional\nsubsistence economy, preservation of natural\nresources—particularly of medicinal herbs throughout\nthe Himalayas—remains a challenge. The growing commercialization\nof natural resources could have negative\nimpacts on fragile ecosystems such as the Himalayas if it\nis not planned in a proper way. A blend of modern agricultural\ntechnology suitable to high altitudes and the\nindigenous knowledge of the Bhotiya would help to\nmake commercialization a promising venture for sustainable\nuse of natural resources and economic devel-\nopment in local communities. But such a strategy\nrequires further research before implementation is possible.\nNurseries as well as gene banks in the form of\nseeds, seedlings, roots, rhizomes, bulbs, and tubers\nshould be encouraged throughout the region; a few\nexperimental studies (eg, Gupta et al 1998) have\nalready been conducted in the Himalayas and show how\nthe use of modern technology can also contribute to\npromoting conservation.\n278\nChandra Shekhar Silori and Ruchi Badola\n', '279\nResearch\nREFERENCES\nAnonymous. 1991.
