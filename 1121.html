Introduction\nHow a micro-founded discipline such as economics could deal with the increasing global\neconomic reality? This question has been asked frequently since the last economic crisis that\nappeared in 2008. Numerous observers (Rickles, 2008; Schinckus, 2009) questioned the\neconomic knowledge and its way of dealing with complex global issues. In this challenging\ncontext, some commentators (Rosser, 2010; Colander et al., 2008; Jovanovic and Schinckus,\n2013) have turned their attention to a new area of knowledge coming from physics:\neconophysics, which is a new hybrid discipline that emerged in the 1990s.

The direct contributions of econophysics to economic knowledge are still\ninconclusive and controversial (see Schinckus, 2010a, b) because this field is still in its\ninfancy and two decades is not enough for developing a coherent unified framework.\nHowever, although these debates, an agreement emerged in the literature (Colander et al.,\n2008; Chakraborti et al., 2011a, b; Schinckus, 2011) on the contributing points which appear\nto be the way of modeling complexity and a potential enlargement of uncertainty.\nOn that point, Colander et al. (2008), for example, wrote that by founding all economic macro\nphenomena on the rational representative agent, economists implicitly set the macro level\nequal to the micro level. These authors added that the consequence is that all\nmacro-concepts such as “market,” “systemic risk” or “financial crisis” are misunderstood in\neconomic theory because these notions are founded on an inappropriate complexity.\nBecause this aspect of complexity is at the heart of econophysics, this field can contribute to\na better understanding of complex economic systems. In the same vein, Schinckus (2009)\nemphasized that econophysics can also enlarge the notion of uncertainty in economics by\nproposing collection of operational instruments for uncertainty situations.\nAlthough the term “econophysics” is the combination of “economics” and “physics,” the\ndialogue between economists and physicists appears to be difficult in the literature:\neconomists consider that econophysicists develop a meaningless knowledge while\neconophysicists present economics as a priorist “tapestry of belief” (McCauley, 2004).\nMoreover these lack of dialogue is enhanced by controversial writings of econophysicists\nwho often tend to exaggerate their contribution to economics and finance by claiming they\ndeal with new concepts (such as invariance or emergence[1]) or stable Levy processes[2].\nIn this perspective, econophysics is sometimes presented as an autonomous emerging field\n(Gingras and Schinckus, 2012) with its own annual conferences[3] and its own academic\neducation and PhD[4].\nDespite these debates, some collaborations between economists and econophysicists\nexist: Farmer and Foley (2009) or Farmer and Lux (2008), for example, who published a\nspecial issue of the Journal of Economic Dynamic and Control dedicated to the “application\nof physics to economics and finance” whose objective was to favor collaboration between\neconomists and econophysicisits, as Farmer and Lux (2008, p. 6) wrote it:\nWe hope that this selection of papers offers an impression of the scope and breadth of the growing\nliterature in the interface between economics/finance and physics, that it will help readers to get\nacquainted with these new approaches and that it will stimulate further collaborations between\nscientists of both disciplines.\nIn addition to these collaborations, some economists have provided a disciplinary reflection\non econophysics (Keen, 2003; Rosser, 2008, 2010), while other authors (Drakopoulos and\nKatselidis, 2013; Jovanovic and Schinckus, 2013) tried to enhance common methodological\npoints between the two fields in order to favor the development of an integrative\ncollaboration enhancing a better modeling of complexity and uncertainty as evoked above.\nHowever, as Jovanovic and Schinckus (2013) wrote it, an integrative collaboration[5]\nbetween these two disciplines requires the elaboration of a common language in order to\nfavor the transfer of meaning in the dialogue. We must admit that the development of this\nin-between language seems today difficult since both, economists and econophysicists claim\nthat their knowledge has nothing to do with the another field. By showing that some\nconceptual aspects (such as emergence or complexity for example) of econophysics are\nconsistent with the perspective developed by J.S. Mill to study economic phenomena, this\npaper emphasizes a methodological argument sustaining that a possible dialogue between\neconophysicists and economists[6] can emerge. That kind of dialogue would not be\nsuperfluous, in this challenging context for economic knowledge, to understand the growing\ncomplexity of economic systems. In terms of history of economic thought, this paper also\n164\nJABES\n25,1\n', 'stresses the contemporary relevance of the Millian framework which provides conceptual\ntools to better understand the development of a new field dealing with economic complexity.\nThe paper is structured into three parts. The first part will present econophysics and the\nkind of complexity we can find in this field. The second part will introduce the major\ndimensions of Mill’s methodology about complexity and emergence. Finally, in the last part, we\nwill identify common methodological points between econophysics and Mill’s methodology.\n2. Between physics and economics\n2.1 The development of econophysics\nPhysics has always been a source of inspiration for economists[7]. However, the\ndevelopment of econophysics appears to be a bit different than usual historical links\nbetween economics and physics. Its practitioners are not economists taking their inspiration\nfrom the work of physicists to develop their discipline, as has been seen repeatedly in the\nhistory of economics[8]. This time, it is physicists that are going beyond the boundaries of\ntheir discipline, using their methods to study various problems thrown up by social sciences.\nEconophysicists do not claim that they are attempting to integrate physics concepts into\neconomics as it exists today, but rather that they are seeking to ignore, even to deny\neconomics and its foundations.\nThis movement out of physics was initiated in the 1970s, when certain physicists began\nto publish articles devoted to the study of social phenomena. While some authors extended\nwhat is called “catastrophe theory[9]” to social sciences, others created a new field labeled\n“sociophysics[10].”\nIn the 1990s, physicists turned their attention to economics, and particularly financial\neconomics[11], giving rise to econophysics. Although the movement’s official birth\nannouncement came in a 1996 article by Stanley et al. (1996), who defined econophysics as\na quantitative analysis of economic systems using ideas, models, conceptual and\ncomputational methods of physics. Although this definition seemed to gain ground as a\ncompromise, and is found in a number of books and articles (Wang et al., 2004; Rickles,\n2007; Lux and Rosser, 2009; Rosser, 2008), an analysis of the themes studied by\neconophysics shows that research conducted in this field can be decomposed into two\ncategories of works: “statistical econophysics” and “agent-econophysics” that we briefly\npresent in the following section.\n2.2 Two approaches in econophysics\nThe distinction between these two sub-fields has been suggested by Chakraborti et al.\n(2011a, b) and detailed by Schinckus (2013a). This distinction refers to the kind of physical\nmethodology physicists extend to economics. Simply said, agents-based econophysics deals\nwith microscopic models applied to heterogeneous agents while statistical econophysics\nrather focuses on macroscopic models describing phenomena through statistical macro\npatterns. Agent-based approach is not a strictly physics-emergent methodology since it\nappeared in the 1990s as a new tool for empirical research in a lot of fields such as economics\n(Axtell, 1999), voting behaviors (Lindgren and Nordahl, 1994), military tactics (Ilachinski,\n1997), organizational behaviors (Prietula et al., 1998), epidemics (Epstein and Axtell, 1996)\nand traffic congestion patterns (Nagel and Rasmussen, 1994). Basically, agent-based models\ncan be looked on as an interdisciplinary approach (Epstein, 2006) dealing with so many\nfields that it is not possible to number them here[12]. The rest of this paper will only deal\nwith statistical econophysics for two reasons: on the one hand, statistical econophysics\nholds a large part of the literature dedicated to econophysics and on the other hand, we will\nshow how this computational approach is consistent with the methodology proposed by\nMill to study economic phenomena.\n165\nDuality of\nknowledge,\nsingularity of\nmethod\n', 'Statistical econophysics comes from statistical physics and it is often associated to what we\ncall “stylized facts” in the economic literature, and which refer to “empirical facts that arose in\nstatistical studies of financial (or economic) time series and that seem to be persistent across\nvarious time periods, places, markets, assets, etc.” (Chakraborti et al., 2010, p. 994).\nFor statistical econophysics, economic systems are composed of multiple components\n(non-adaptive agents) interacting in such a way as to generate the macro properties for systems\n(Rickles, 2008, p. 4). These macro properties can be characterized in terms of statistical\nregularities[13]. In opposition to economics or agent-based econophysics, statistical\neconophysics considers that only the macro level of the system can be observed and\nanalyzed. Economic systems therefore consist of a large number of components (agents,\ntraders, speculators, etc.) whose interactions generate observable macro properties that all\ncomponents obey. Within this perspective, there is no modeling of the rational or/and\nindividual behavior[14] and the main objective is to describe the past economic data through\nmodels whose ability to describe is implicitly associated with the explanatory dimension of the\nmodels (Schinckus, 2013b).\n2.3 Econophysics and complexity\nDescribing socioeconomic system as complex systems suggesting the unavoidable result of\nbringing together numerous components in a non-simple manner is a methodological\nperspective shared by statistical and agent-based econophysicists. Both consider economic\nsystems as an obvious candidate for the complexity treatment because these systems are\ncomposed by multiple components (agents) interacting in such a way as to generate the\nmacro properties for economic systems and sub-systems (Rickles, 2008, p. 4).\nRosser (2003, 2006, 2008), Colander et al. (2008) and Mirowski (2012) provided a very\ninteresting discussion about the interdisciplinary dimension of complexity and its\ninfluences on economics. Although complexity is a slippery concept, there exists a\nspecialized literature dedicated to “complexity science” in which a lot of different\nconceptualizations are proposed: hierarchical complexity (Simon, 1962), algorithmic\ncomplexity (Chaitin, 1987), stochastic complexity (Rissanen, 1989), dynamic complexity\n(Day, 1994), computational complexity (Albin and Foley, 1998; Velupillai, 2000), etc. As\nreported by Horgan (1997, p. 305), Llyod has identified more than 45 definitions of\ncomplexity. However, whatever the complexity may be, a complex system might roughly be\ncharacterized as follows:\nBy complex system I mean one made up of a large number of parts that interact in a non-simple\nway. In such systems, the whole is more than the sum of its parts, not in an ultimate, metaphysical\nsense, but in the important pragmatic sense that, given the properties of the parts and the laws of\ntheir interaction, it is not a trivial matter to infer properties of the whole (Simon, 1981, p. 4).\nBy considering economic systems as macroscopic complex systems with an internal\nmicroscopic structure consisting of many interacting particles, econophysics is presented as\nfield based on a dynamic complexity (Rosser, 2005, 2006). Schinckus (2013b) showed that this\nperspective must be detailed since econophysics can be associated with two different kinds of\ncomplexities referring to the two kinds of econophysics we presented in the previous section:\nthe agent-based econophysics (whose aim is to reproduce past data) and statistical\neconophysics (whose objective is to describe past data). While the first is based on what we\ncall a “small tent complexity,” the second is rather founded on a more hierarchical complexity.\nThis section aims to present a distinction between these two complexities by giving more\ndetails on the hierarchical complexity since it deals with statistical econophysics that we will\nassociate with the Millian perspective of emergence and complexity.\n2.3.1 Small tent complexity: from micro-interactions to emergence. Small tent complexity\ndescribes situations where a huge number of micro-interactions generate emergent\n166\nJABES\n25,1\n', 'properties. Although this definition is large, Arthur et al. (1997) identified six joint\ncharacteristics related to this specific complexity: dispersed interaction among locally\ninteracting heterogeneous agents, no global controller who could exploit opportunities\nresulting from these dispersed interactions, cross-cutting hierarchical organization with\ntangled interactions, continual learning and adaptation of agents, novelty and mutations of\nthe system and out-of-equilibrium dynamics.\nBased on this categorization, Rosser (2008, p. 19) and Lux and Rosser (2009, p. 35) wrote\nthat this “complexity can be seen to be very compatible with what is implied by many\neconophysics models.” In line with these works, Schinckus (2013b) showed that agent-based\neconophysics deal with this “small tent complexity” defined by Arthur et al. (1997).\nAlthough we had to mention it here, this complexity and the kind of econophysics it implies\n(agent-based econophysics), we will not deal with it in this paper[15] which rather focuses on\ncomplexity related to statistical econophysics.\n2.3.2 Hierarchical complexity: from regularities to emergence. Hierarchical complexity\ndescribes the functioning of a system composed by multiple levels of inter-related subsystems[16]\n(Simon, 1962, 1996). Like the notion of complexity, the concept of hierarchy\nrefers to several meanings discussed in a prolific literature (Lane, 2006) whose more famous\nworks have been written by Simon (1962, 1996), Anderson (1972) and Holland (1999). This\nsection presents major definitions of hierarchical complexity by beginning with the Simon’s\nworks completed by Anderson (1972) and Holland (1999). This evolution in the way of\nthinking complexity is necessary for understanding the complexity used in statistical\neconophysics (but also the one used in Millian perspective of complexity).\nAccording to Simon (1962), hierarchy is a key concept in complexity since he defined\n“hierarchic system as one composed of multiple levels of inter-related sub-systems.” In other\nwords, distinctly operating sub-systems are combined to form a higher order operating\nsystem. By claiming that hierarchic systems have some common properties independent of\ntheir specific content, Simon (1996, p. 184) explained that self-organization and hierarchy are\ndeeply interlinked[17]. In this perspective, the sub-systems interact with one another on an\ninput-output basis meaning that their dynamics can change without impacting the system\nin its whole if they are able to produce the same outputs from different inputs. Although\nSimon developed a very coherent framework, the specialized literature emphasized the two\nmain limitations to his definition of hierarchical complexity: on the one hand, it appears as a\nstatic structure (Holland, 1999) and on the other hand, it does not explain clearly the\napparition of new levels (Anderson, 1972; Holland, 1999).\nAbout this last point, Anderson (1972) provided a theoretical framework connecting\ncomplexity, hierarchy and emergence. According to Anderson (1972), emergence is the\nexplaining phenomenon of hierarchy in complex systems. This author referred to the notion of\nscale in order to describe the organization of existing entities at each level of the system. A\nstimulated complex system creates interactions between entities and then new kinds of\nproperties arise implying a new level of complexity based on what Anderson (1972, p. 393)\ncalled the “theory of broken symmetry.” More precisely, these new properties change the\nsystem which needs not have all the symmetries of the laws that govern its constituents\n(Lane, 2006). By proposing this theory of broken symmetry, Anderson offered a specific law\ndescribing the phenomenon of emergence[18]. In this perspective, he wanted to explain the\napparition of new levels. According to Simon, “the structure explains how complex systems\nworks” (Lane, 2006) while Anderson rather presented the mechanism of emergence\n(characterized by the theory of broken symmetry) as the explanation of hierarchical complexity.\nHolland (1999) continued the Anderson’s idea since he provided “a setting in which\nemergence may be defined” (Lane, 2006, p. 91). For Holland, complexity is still a matter of\nstructure but the apparition of new levels must be characterized through an emergence process.\n167\nDuality of\nknowledge,\nsingularity of\nmethod\n', 'More precisely, emergent properties result from complex relations implied by emergence that\ncreates persistent regularities. A persistent pattern is a phenomenological regularity emerging\nfrom complex interactions of the system’s components (Holland, 1999). Holland also used the\nterm of “macrolaw” to describe an emergent regularity that makes no reference to the\nmechanisms and connection structure between individual elements of the system in which it\narises[19]. The idea of persistence is important for Holland who emphasized this notion in his\nfinal chapter when he summarized in eight points his conclusion about emergence. He wrote\n(point 3) that “emergent phenomena are, typically, persistent patterns with changing\ncomponents” and that “persistent patterns often satisfy macrolaws” (point 6). By associating\nemergence with a persistence (which structured the hierarchical organization of the system),\nHolland implicitly generated debates about the meaning of persistence which appears, in his\nbook, like an “observed regularity” or a kind of “invariance[20].” Because statistical\neconophysics considered that regularities observed in complex systems are emerging patterns,\nSchinckus (2013b) explained that this approach of econophysics can directly be associated with\nhierarchical complexity enhanced by Holland (1999).\n3. Mill and emergence\nThis section aims to present the Millian concept of emergence by focusing on what Mill\ncalled “heteropathic causation.” The discussion proposed in this section will allow us to\nbetter understand the conceptual links existing between the Millian perspective of\ncomplexity and econophysics.\n3.1 Classical emergentism\nEmergence is a notorious philosophical concept that arises a lot of philosophical discussions\n(Kauffman, 1993; Hodgson, 1998; Jean; 1997). Often defined as the claim according to which\n“things can be greater than the sum of their parts,” emergence can take various forms[21]\ndepending on the kind of relation between entities (or properties) of a system. For Goldstein\n(1999, p. 50), emergence can be roughly defined as “the arising of novel structures, patterns\nand properties during the process of self-organization in complex system” (Corning, 2002).\nFor Epstein and Axtell (1996), emergence refers to stable macroscopic patterns arising from\nlocal interaction of agents.” Cunningham (2001, p. 62) reminds that emergence is an old idea\nthat has been reemployed in the 1990s with the development of “complexity science” in\nwhich we observe a “re-emergence of emergence.”\nThe idea of emergence dates back to the old British Emergenstism described by Alexander\n(1920) and Morgan (1923), Broad (1925) and of course, Mill (1843/1973). In the reductionist\nframework dominating science between the 1930s and the 1960s, emergentists proposed an\nopposite way of thinking since they claim that emergence referred to the properties of\nthe whole which, on the one hand, cannot be deduced from the properties of the parts; and on\nthe other hand, is not reducible to the laws governing these parts. In this perspective,\nemergence appeared as a macroscopic phenomenon with no micro-foundations. Epstein (2006,\np. 32) emphasized that emergentists favored an “absolute unexplainability” and an “antiscientific”\nmeaning of emergence while Gregersen (2006) described the deistic and religious\ndimension of this definition. In the 1940s, Hempel and Oppenheim (1948, p. 568) explained that\n“this version of emergence is objectionable not only because it involves and perpetuates\ncertain logical confusions but also because not unlike the ideas of neovitalism, it encourages\nan attitude of resignation which is stifling to scientific research[22].”\n3.2 Mill and the concept of emergence\nBritish Emergentists[23] of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries were the first to\nwork on the notion of emergence and to provide a specific definition of this term[24].\n168\nJABES\n25,1\n', 'The common question was to know whether macro properties of a system were reducible to\nits components or not. Mill (1843/1973), Alexander (1920), Morgan (1923) and Broad (1925)\ndeveloped then some epistemological frameworks in response to this question of\nreducibility. In this paper, we focus especially on the Mill’s stance by emphasizing why\nMillian emergence is close to the notion of emergence used in statistical econophysics\nevoked in the previous section.\nThe first definition of emergence[25] appears in the System of Logic written by J.S Mill\n(1843/1973, Book 3, Chapter 6, §1):\nAll organized bodies are composed of parts, similar to those composing inorganic nature,\nand which have even themselves existed in an inorganic state; but the phenomena of\nlife, which result from the juxtaposition of those parts in a certain manner, bear no analogy to any\nof the effects which would be produced by the action of the component substances considered as\nmere physical agents. To whatever degree we might imagine our knowledge of the properties of\nthe several ingredients of a living body to be extended and perfected, it is certain that no mere\nsumming up of the separate actions of those elements will ever amount to the action of the living\nbody itself.\nMill extended his claim to inorganic systems and proposed a more general definition of\nemergence based on a non-reducibility of the macro level but also on a reject of what he\ncalled the “Composition of Causes.” “I shall give the name of Composition of Causes to the\nprinciple which is exemplified in all cases in which the joint effect of several causes is\nidentical with the sum of their separate effects” (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 370).\nAccording to Mill, emergent properties are not subject to this law ( Jean, 1997, p. 4). The\ndistinction between emergent and non-emergent properties corresponds then to a distinction\nregarding two different ways in which conjoint causes can produce an effect: non-emergent\nproperties are effects that can be viewed as a mere sum of the effects of each of the causal\nconjuncts while emergent properties are effects that are not a sum of the effects of each\ncausal conjunct.\nThe Millian emergence is close to what Goldstein (1999, p. 50) calls “strong emergence”\nand Stephan (1999, p. 69) calls “diachronic emergence.” This kind of emergence describes\nnew properties arising in systems as a result of the interactions at an elemental level and\nthese emergent properties are not reducible to the properties of components of the system.\nThe main characteristics of a diachronic emergence are then novelty (new properties at a\nmacro level) and irreducibility of the macro result. This way of conceptualizing the notion of\nemergence must be defined in contrast to a “synchronic emergence” that simply refers to a\nsystem within reducibility is conceivable[26].\nMill was the first to give a definition to the “compositional emergence” (Deacon, 2006,\np. 122) that corresponds to a macro phenomenon that coming from non-simple interactions\nbetween lower level entities. This kind of emergence corresponds to an endogenous\nphenomenon that deterministically generates erratically dynamic results at higher levels of\nthe system (Rosser, 2006, p. 1). Properties of the system are then fully defined by internal\nproperties of its proprietary entity’s components even if the first cannot be reduced to the\nsum of the latter (Cunnigham, 2001, p. 68). In this case, Mill explained that the system must\nnecessary be studied through a macro perspective.\nAccording to Mill, the chemical causation observed in the case of water is an example of\n“strong emergence” (called “compositional emergence”): “for example, two gaseous\nsubstances, hydrogen and oxygen, on being brought together, throw off their peculiar\nproperties, and produce the substance called water)” (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 440), in other words,\n“the laws of the original agents cease entirely, and a phenomenon makes its appearance,\nwhich, with reference to those laws, is quite heterogeneous” (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 440). Water\nis then considered as a new fact that “may be subjected to experimental inquiry, like any\nother phenomenon; and the elements which are said to compose it may be considered as the\n169\nDuality of\nknowledge,\nsingularity of\nmethod\n', 'mere agents of its production; the conditions on which it depends, the facts which make up\nits cause” (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 440):\nSo, if we decompose water by means of iron filings, we produce two effects, rust and hydrogen: now\nrust is already known by experiments upon the component substances, to be an effect of the union\nof iron and oxygen: the iron we ourselves supplied, but the oxygen must have been produced from\nthe water. The result therefore is that t water has disappeared, and hydrogen and oxygen have\nappeared in its stead: or in other words, the original laws of these gaseous agents, which had been\nsuspended by the superinduction of the new laws called the properties of water, have again started\ninto existence, and the causes of water are found among its effects (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 441).\nAccording to Mill, emergence is still a matter of causality but it is a particular causality that\nhe called heteropathic. Therefore, Millian emergence is a causal phenomenon based on a\nspecific causality between lower and higher levels of the system. This point is important\nbecause despite emergists agreed on the fact that emergence is a macro result, these authors\ndid not share the same explanation about link between micro and macro levels. According to\nBroad (1925), for example, Millian emergence is not a causal phenomenon as emphasized by\nO’Connor and Wong (2006):\nMill’s dynamical account of emergence differs from the synchronic, noncausal covariational account\nof the relationship of emergent features to the conditions that give rise to them that Broad was to\nespouse in Mind and Its Place in Nature (1925). Mill’s account is thus an important precursor to the\natypical dynamical account of emergence in the literature today (O’Connor and Wong, 2006, p. 23).\nAmong British emergentists[27], Mill implicitly used a compositional, dynamic and causal\nemergence in which the link between lower and higher levels can be characterized by a\nheteropathic causality that Mill defined as a breach of the principle of Composition of Causes:\nThough there are laws which, like those of chemistry and physiology, owe their existence to a\nbreach of the principle of Composition of Causes, it does not follow that these peculiar, or as they\nmight be termed, heteropathic laws, are not capable of composition with one another (Mill, 1843/\n1973, p. 375).\nHeteropathic causality corresponds to a class of phenomena where the joint action of\nmultiple causes is not the sum of effect of the causes acting individually[28]. Mill defined\nheteropathic causality in contrast to a homopathic causality (O’Connor and Wong, 2006)\nwhere the total effect of several causes acting in concert is identical to what would have been\nthe sum of the effects of each of the causes acting alone. According to Mill, homopathic\ncause would be a mechanical causality which is in line with the principle of Composition of\nCauses while heteropatic causality would refer rather to a more chemical causality\ncharacterized by a violation of this principle[29].\nBedau (1997), Clayton and Davies (2006) and Francescotti (2007) explained that the\nnotion of emergence[30] refers implicitly to a downward causation that can be found in\nthe Millian framework (Stephan, 2002; Hendry, 2006). More precisely, Jean (1997) defined the\nheteropathic causality as downward causation:\nIf we find a cause between the level n [or micro-level] and n+ 1 or [macro-level], there is no\nemergence because the latter is reducible to the first. In order to have emergence, a downward\ncausality between n+ 1 and n must be found Jean (1997, p. 330).\nHeteropathic causality is a top-down causation in which the macro result of the system\nrestricts the micro levels’ configuration. Downward causation takes place with higher level\ncontexts influencing the outcome of lower level functioning. The components are then\nrestricted once emergence properties appeared. The process of downward causality is the\nfollowing: each microscopic state is undetermined but a macro property emerges and then the\nmacro level of the system can be described through a statistical regularity which, in return,\n170\nJABES\n25,1\n', 'will restrict the micro levels configurations (i.e. we can deduce information about the micro\nlevels only when macro properties are observed). A simple example is the brain interactions:\nthe brain can control its atoms and molecules rather than the opposite (Clayton and Davies,\n2006). Once having emerged from lower level, macro-process determines their components[31].\nWe can also mention an example from the economic theory of Mill which emphasized the\ninfluence of civilized society that changes the security of person and property.\n4. Econophysics and the Millian perspective\nAs mentioned in the introduction, economists and econophysicists do not really dialogue\npreferring rather to adopt what anthropologists call a “scientific tribalism” (Bailey, 1977)\nwhich do not make impossible exchanges between communities as Bailey (1977) wrote it:\nEach tribe has a name and a territory, settles it own affairs, goes to war with others, has a distinct\nlanguage or at least a distinct dialect and a variety of symbolic ways of demonstrating its apartness\nfrom others. Nevertheless the whole set of tribes possess a common culture: their ways of\nconstructing the world and the people who live in it are sufficiently similar for them to be able to\nunderstand, more or less, each other’s culture and even, when necessary, to communicate with\nmembers of other tribes. Universities possess a single culture which directs interaction between the\nmany distinct and often mutually hostile groups (Bailey, 1977, p. 35).\nThis cultural ability of scientists to interact often generates the apparition of subdisciplinaries\n(Becher, 1994). However, Galison (1997) explained that this kind of\ninteractions between two scientific communities requires the development of a “pidgin”\nwhich refers to an interim language based on partial agreement on the meaning of shared\nterms (between involved disciplines) (Klein, 1990). In other words, a real collaboration\nbetween economists and econophysicists requires the integration of theoretical concepts\nused in each discipline in such way that the new shared framework will make sense in\neach discipline. As Farmer and Foley (2009), Rosser (2010) and Jovanovic and Schinckus\n(2013) emphasized it, such a dialogue could be fruitful for each fields for the development\nof a new theoretical tools. Although this kind of integration does not exist yet between\neconomics and econophysics, this section paves the way for the potential elaboration of an\ninterim language between these two fields. More precisely, we will show that several\nconceptual aspects used in statistical econophysics are consistent with the methodology\nproposed by J.S. Mill to study economic phenomena. Six arguments sustaining this claim\nare detailed in this section.\n4.1 Emergence as invariance\nWhen he observed emergent properties in a complex phenomenon, Mill explained that\nthere is a constant characterizing the relation between micro states. More precisely, Mill\nwrote that:\nThe different actions of a chemical compound will never, undoubtedly, be found to be the sums of\nthe actions of its separate elements; but there may exist, between the properties of the compound\nand those of its elements, some constant relation, which, if discoverable by a sufficient induction,\nwould enable us to foresee the sort of compound which will result from a new combination before\nwe have actually tried it, and to judge of what sort of elements some new substance is compounded\nbefore we have analysed it (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 375).\nTherefore, Mill implicitly considered that “something” is constant and can characterize the\ncomplexity of the observed phenomenon. In other words, according to Mill, although\nthe sum of the actions of separate elements of a complex phenomenon cannot describe the\nmacro level of the system, this macro level can be described through a constant relation\nbetween lower and upper states. In a sense, this constant relation allows us to give a\n171\nDuality of\nknowledge,\nsingularity of\nmethod\n', 'meaning to this phenomenon. Moreover, Mill also emphasized the existence of an\n“constancy” in different social phenomena:\nYet in any large country, the number of murders, in proportion to the population, varies (it has been\nfound) very little from one year to another, and in its variations never deviates widely from a\ncertain average. What is still more remarkable, there is a similar approach to constancy in the\nproportion of these murders annually committed with every particular kind of instrument. There is\na like approximation to identity, as between one year and another, in the comparative number of\nlegitimate and of illegitimate births. The same thing is found true of suicides, accidents, and all\nother social phenomena of which the registration is sufficiently perfect; one of the most curiously\nillustrative examples being the fact, ascertained by the registers of the London and Paris postoffices,\nthat the number of letters posted which the writers have forgotten to direct, is nearly the\nsame, in proportion to the whole number of letters posted, in one year as in another. “Year after\nyear,” says Mr. Buckle, “the same proportion of letter-writers forget this simple act; so that for each\nsuccessive period we can actually foretell the number of persons whose memory will fail them in\nregard to this trifling, and as it might appear, accidental occurrence (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 932).\nAccording to Mazlish (1988, p. 23), this idea that emergence can be associated with a\nconstant relation (which implicitly appears as a scientific law) shows the positivist\ninfluences observed in Mill’s works.\nWe have the same way of characterizing complex phenomena in statistical econophysics.\nBasically, this constant relation between compound and components evoked by Mill,\ncorresponds to what we call today a scaling law, i.e. a constant ratio between the probability\nof observing an event of magnitude x and observing one of x’. This ratio does not depend on\nthe standard or measurement; it is constant whatever the “scale of observation.” In other\nwords, when a system is characterized through a scaling law, a constant relation is then\npresupposed between components and the system. The emergence of a such constant\nrelation is very important for economics and especially finance because it implies that\nstatistical distribution do obey to scaling relations at different time horizons (daily, weekly,\nmonthly, etc.). This concept of scaling allows us to describe a financial distribution through\nthe same statistic features independently of time horizon.\nThese scaling laws evoked in the previous paragraph are statistical patterns resulting from\ncomplex interactions between microscopic states whose interacting individual behaviors\ncannot be described[32]. This importance of statistical regularities in complex phenomena can\nalso be found in the eighth edition (1872) of Mill’s treatise who have been acquainted with\nstatistics thanks to Buckle’s popularizing efforts (Morgan, 1990). In line with phenomenological\nregularities that Holland (1999) called macro laws, these regularities are presented as persistent\npatterns whose results are more than the mere sum of micro patterns governing all particles\nimplying a specific case of the “theory of broken symmetry” defined by Anderson (1972) and\nsummarized by Gallegati et al. (2006) when they explained the broken symmetry between the\nmacro-configuration of a system and the micro states composing this system:\n[…] (statistical) equilibrium of a system no longer requires that every single element be in\nequilibrium by itself, but rather that the statistical distributions describing aggregate phenomena\nbe stable, i.e. in a state of macroscopic equilibrium maintained by a large number of transitions in\nopposite directions (Gallegati et al., 2006, p. 22).\nBy associating emergence with no deducible, no reducible and no predictive macro laws[33],\nstatistical econophysics provides a strong and synchronic emergentism in line with the\nclassical British emergentism proposed by J.S. Mill.\n4.2 The macro perspective\nThe macro perspective is very important in the Millian works. The economic phenomenon,\nfor example, is so complex that Mill preferred to focus on “macroscopic effects” that result\n172\nJABES\n25,1\n', 'from the influence of the progress of society and government rather than on “microscopic\neffects.” Indeed, although Mill (1843/1973, p. 879) wrote that “the Composition of Causes is\nthe universal in social phenomena,” he considered economics as a specific discipline that\n“may admit of being carved out of general body of the social sciences” (Mill, 1843/1973,\np. 901). More precisely, Mill wandered economics from what he called the “political\nethology”whose main objective was to define the “type of character belonging to a people or\nto an age” (Mill, 1843, p. 905). This field was supposed to study the influence of a\nmacroscopic feature (example, the national character) on the behaviors of individuals.\nDefining individual economic behavior only initiated by the motive for the “desire for\nwealth,” economists did abstract the effects of “aversion to labor, and desire of the present\nenjoyment of costly indulgences” (Mill, 1843/1973, pp. 322, 902). However, as Persky (1995, p. 3)\nwrote, Mill is eager for a measure of the separate effects resulting from these two motives on\nthe desire of wealth mentioning that it is a study which is too complicated and sophisticated to\nbe studied from a strictly micro-perspective (Akdere, 2010)[34]. Mill (1843/1973, p. 330) thought\nthat these effects “have not fallen under the cognizance of the science” but “our attention is not\nunduly diverted from any of them” (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 330). In a Millian perspective then,\ncomplex economic systems must be studied with a macro-approach in which “the qualities\ndisplayed by the collective body are able to judge what must be the qualities of the majority of\nthe individual composing it” (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 902).\nAs previously explained, this preference for the macro-analysis is also essential in\nstatistical econophysics where individual economic behaviors are seen too complicated and\nsophisticated to be individually studied. Only the statistical macro-regularities emerging\nfrom components’ interactions can then scientifically be studied. These statistical patterns\nappear to be emergent properties founded on what Mill called a heteropathic causality that\nwe detail in the following section.\n4.3 The heteropathic perspective\nClassical economics is based on a methodological individualism which presupposes a\nlinearity and homogeneity of elements composing the economic systems (Colander et al.,\n2008). Equilibrium, for example, often results from an addition of homogeneous maximizing\nbehavior of individuals who are supposed to have the same expectations. Because the macro\nphenomena is reduced to the simple addition of individual behaviors, this approach can be\nconsidered as linear in a sense that it does not consider a potential endogenous emergence\nresulting from a complex interaction between elements. Colander et al. (2008) explained a lot\nof macro-concepts such as “market” or “systemic risk” are usually misunderstood in\neconomic theory because these notions are based on an inappropriate causation[35].\nMethodological individualism implies a homeopathic causation in which all macro\nphenomena result from the total effect of several causes acting in concert is identical to what\nwould have been the sum of the effects of each of the individual causes (actors) acting alone\n(O’Connor and Wong, 2006). As previously explained, Mill emphasized the heterogeneity of\ncauses through what he called a heteropathic causation referring to situations where the\njoint action of multiple causes is not the sum effects of the causes acting individually. In line\nwith this perspective, statistical econophysicists presuppose an heterogeneity of\ninteractions, all of which depend on the initial conditions (positions in the system) and\nthe distance between particles[36]. For example, Donangelo and Sneppen (2000), as well as\nShinohara and Gunji (2001), have approached the emergence of money through studying the\ndynamics of exchange in a system composed of many interacting heterogeneous agents. By\ndeveloping a reciprocity model in which interactions between agents are asynchronous[37],\nthese authors showed that fluctuations in exchanges can be quantified by through a\nnon-Gaussian statistical pattern. More precisely, these authors provided a non-linear and\nheteropathic causality in which joint action (emergence of the same means of payment,\n173\nDuality of\nknowledge,\nsingularity of\nmethod\n', 'money) of multiple causes (interactions between bartering agents) is not the sum of effect of\nthe causes acting individually. Moreover, the dynamics of this joint action (emergence\nof money) can be characterized with a specific statistical macro-law. This way of dealing the\nemergent properties through a heteropathic causation is directly consistent with the Millian\nmethodology presented in the previous part of this paper.\n4.4 The downward causality\nHeteropathic causation defined by Mill implies a downward causation which is also observed\nin statistical econophysics. As previously mentioned, econophysicists describe macro\nregularities emerging from a complex system in terms of statistics. Rickles (2007) explained\nhow econophysics mainly use “power laws[38]” for characterizing macro patterns. More\nformally, a power law can be summarized as p(x) ~ x-α (where p(x) is the probability of there\nbeing an event of magnitude x and the scaling exponent α is a constant which is set by the\nempirically observed behavior of the systems). From a statistical point of view, these macro\nlaws restrict the lower levels. In other words, the micro levels must be organized in accordance\nwith a specific macro factor which is, for the power laws, the scaling exponent. More precisely,\nthe scaling exponent α will restrict the micro level of data[39]. In other words, given the\nexponent α characterizing a complex system (whose micro states are undefined), we have\ninformation about the potential configuration of the micro level[40] (Kitto, 2006).\nA less technical example can easily be found in arguments such as “stock market\nvolatility made investors nervous”which conveys the impression that the higher level entity\n(the volatility of the market) partly determines how individual agents behave (McCauley,\n2006). In other words, all fluctuations of this macroscopic volatility will determine\nthe behavior of lower level actors in a system within micro-components are said to be\ndetermined by macro properties as Rickles (2008, p. 7) explained it:\nThe idea is that in statistical physics, systems that consist of a large number of interacting parts\noften are found to obey “universal laws” – laws independent [causally] of microscopic details and\ndependent on just a few macroscopic parameters.\nWe can, for example, mention some works dealing with this downward causation in\neconophysics such as Chatterjee and Chakrabarti (2007) or Aoyama et al. (2011), who\ndescribed complex economic systems (dynamics of competition between firms) through a\nspecific network structure which directly influences all the subunits (companies).\n4.5 The empirical argument\nThe importance of empiricism can be seen as another similarity between Millian framework\nand econophysics since both frameworks presuppose that complexity studies need an\nempirical approach. Facing to a chemical (complex) phenomenon, the empirical dimension\nappears to be, in a Millian framework, the only way to understand the emergence. While\nThierry (1998, p. 157) explained that “Mill is an empiricist close to Macaulay” who “rejects\nthe idea to found a knowledge on a general theoretical principles[41],” Smart (1999, p. 246)\nalso stressed the empiricist dimension of Mill who claimed that heteropathic complexity\nmust be empirically studied:\nIn the cases where heteropathic effects is a transformation of its cause […] the problem of finding\nthe causes resolves itself into the one of finding an effect which is the kind of inquiry that admits of\nbeing prosecuted by direct experiment”[42] (Mill, 1843/1973, p. 42).\nAccording to Thierry (1998), the emphasis on the importance of empirical approach of Mill\nhelped, at his time, to economics to declare its independence from moral philosophy.\nAs Maricic (1992, p. 530) puts, “one of the task to accomplish, for J.S. Mill, here and there of\nboundaries of the discipline: it’s to precise the nature of its scientificity.”\n174\nJABES\n25,1\n', 'In econophysics, “the real empirical data are certainly at the core of this whole enterprise\n[Econophysics] and the models are built around it, rather than some non-existent, ideal\nmarket [as in Economics][43]” (Rickles (2007, p. 6). Stanley (1999, p. 157) underline that,\ndimension by explaining that “in contrast to standard economics, econophysicists begin\nempirically with real data that one can analyze in some detail but without prior models.”\nBy starting with real data, econophysicists set empirical dimension in the heart of\ncomplexity studies. Because econophysicists continuously emphasize the necessity to\ndevelop data-driven models, their field is considered as a very empiricist one founded on a\nneo-positivist epistemology[44] (Schinckus, 2011). Although this data-driven methodology\nperspective is not really used in economics, it could be useful in economics as Colander et al.\n(2008, p. 11) explained it:\nWe recommend a more dada-driven methodology. Instead of starting out with ad-hoc specification\nand questionable ceteris paribus assumptions, the key features of the data should be explored via\ndata-analytical tools and specifications tests.\nThis section stressed that econophysicists and Mill seems to be on the same wavelength\nabout the importance of empirical dimension in the study of complex economic systems.\n4.6 The “free will” argument\nAccording to Mill, the development and use of “free will” are the essence of political thought\nand it is also a necessity for science to take it into account (Heydt, 2006):\nOur will causes our bodily actions in the same sense, and in no other, in which cold causes ice, or a\nspark causes an explosion of gunpowder. The volition, a state of our mind, is the antecedent; the\nmotion of our limbs in conformity to the volition, is the consequent.” (Mill, 1843/1973, III.v.11).\nDespite the fact that econophysicists do not justify their approach by using a political\nargument, the statistical emergence they developed seems to be directly in line with political\nideas of Mill. As Rosser (2003) explains, “econophysics formulations implicitly assume\nheterogeneous actors,” i.e., “large numbers of interacting subunits that display free will”\n(Amaral et al., 1999). This link between the probabilistic nature of the laws of statistical\n(and quantum) mechanics and free will was developed by Majorana (1942) and summarized\nby Bouchaud (2002, p. 24) as follows:\nThe statistical framework is particularly well adapted to describe the free will (real or supposed) of\nindividuals. Each actor is at liberty to act as he/she wants according to personal and complex\nreasons that are difficult to understand. The collective behaviours, observed in their anonymous\ntotality, have a regularity as we can find in physics.\nSeveral authors (Liu et al., 1997) have underlined this possibility to theorize individuals’\nfree will in econophysics. Artemi (2009) provides some analyses concerning the connection\nbetween econophysics and politics by providing a parallel between the statistical\napproach used in econophysics and democracy. Some econophysical models applied to\ngame theory ( Jimenez, 2004) try to parameterize this “free will” through the notion of\nentropy. This parameter is a measure of dispersion, disorder and uncertainty in the\ndynamic process (Dionisio et al., 2005). In this perspective defining the micro\ncomplexity through the individual free will as econophysicists do it, could be seen as a\nMillian argument.\n5. Conclusion: “Duality is not a story […] duality is a complexity”\n(E. Norton – Fight Club movie)\nThe last economic crisis called our ability to understand economic systems into questions. In\nthis challenging context, a dual knowledge combining economics and physics could be very\n175\nDuality of\nknowledge,\nsingularity of\nmethod\n', 'useful to better grasp the increasingly complex economic systems. Although some authors\n(McCauley, 2006; Schinckus, 2010a; Gingras and Schinckus, 2012) wrote that econophysics and\neconomics are different fields, we claim in this paper that the methodology developed by the first\nis more embedded in the latter than econophycisits claim it. Indeed, whatever they pretend,\neconophysicists deal with notions that have already been studied in economics. This\nmethodological paper shows how some key concepts used by econophysicists can be founded in\neconomics and, more precisely, within the methodology developed by one the Father of\nLiberalism: J.S. Mill. In this perspective, the contribution of this paper is twofold, beyond\nemphasizing the contemporary relevance of Mill’s methodology; it shows that conceptual\nbridges between economics and econophysics exist, favoring therefore the elaboration of a dual\nknowledge based on these two fields whose collaboration, in a challenging context, would not be\nsuperfluous in order to clarify economic complexity.\nNotes\n1. This paper will show that economists already know these concepts.\n2. See Rosser (2008) on that point.\n3. See PhysicsWorld.com.\n4. New PhD programs in econophysics have recently appeared. Available at: phys.uh.edu/research/\neconophysics/index.php and Kutner and Grech (2008).\n5. That Jovanovic and Schinckus (2013) called a “transdisciplinary approach.”\n6. We acknowledge the existence of other common methodological similarities; we just investigate\nhere the case related to the notion of emergence developed by J.S. Mill.\n7. There is a huge literature dedicated to the influence of physics on economics: Mirowski, (1989),\nIngrao and Israel (1990) and Schabas (1990). For an excellent introduction to the analysis of\nmethodology transfer between physical sciences and economics, see Le Gall (2002).\n8. Let us mention some exception such as Fisher Black, for example, who was physicists but\ndecided to “come” into financial economics. See Mehrling (2005).\n9. Catastrophe theory originated with the work of the French Mathematician René Thom in the\n1960s. It became popular in the 1970s as a result of the efforts of Christopher Zeeman (1974, 1977)\nwho proposed the term “catastrophe theory.” This theory is a special case of singularity theory,\nwhich is in turn the key of bifurcation theory, part of the study of nonlinear dynamical systems\n(see Rosser, 2007, for further information about this theory applied in economics).\n10. This term was proposed by Serge Galam in a 1982 article. In his view, one of the reasons why\nphysicists attempt to explain social phenomena stems from a kind of mismatch between the\ntheoretical power of physics and the inert nature of its subject matter: “During my research, I\nstarted to advocate the use of modern theory phase transitions to describe social, psychological,\npolitical and economical phenomena. My claim was motivated by an analysis of some\nepistemological contradictions within physics. On the one hand, the power of concepts and tools\nof statistical physics were enormous, and on the other hand, I was expecting that physics would\nsoon reach the limits of investigating inert matter” (Galam, 2004, p. 50).\n11. The influence of physics on the study of financial markets is not new, as witnessed by the work of\nBachelier (1900/1995) and Black and Scholes (1973). Nevertheless, we cannot yet refer to Black\nand Scholes’ model as econophysics in the term’s current meaning, since it was completely\nintegrated into the dominant theoretical current of economics and finance (Kast, 1991).\nIn opposition to the conceptual translation of heat diffusion process that Black proposed in his\nfamous option pricing model (Black and Scholes, 1973), econophysicists do not translate physical\nconcepts they are using into an existing economic framework.\n12. See Chakraborti et al. (2011a, b) or Schinckus (2013b) for a detailed presentation of these approaches.\n176\nJABES\n25,1\n', '13. See McCauley (2004) for further information about the importance of macro-regularities in\neconophysics.\n14. In this perspective, statistical econophysicists avoid the difficult task of theorizing about the\nindividual psychology (or rationality) of investors since they do not care about rational agent\ntheory or the personal characteristics (utility and so on) of individuals (Brandouy, 2005).\n15. See Charkraborti (2011b) and Schinckus (2013a) for further details about agent-based\neconophysics.\n16. Hierarchical complexity can be looked on as a necessary but not sufficient condition to have the\n“small tent complexity” (Arthur et al., 1997).\n17. Simon added that entities involved in complex systems can be decomposable through a vertical and\na horizontal analysis (that the author compared this organization to Chinese boxes). Vertical\ninteractions imply that entities interact with other entities from the same level of hierarchy while\nhorizontal coupling means that entities “at a particular level tend to cluster into weakly interacting\nsub-systems whose detailed dynamics are independent of one another” (Lane, 2006, p. 85).\n18. Before Anderson (1972), the only law characterizing the emergence referred to the classical\nemergentism and the fact that the whole is more than the mere sum of components.\n19. For example of macrolaws, see Chapter 10 of Holland (1999).\n20. See Lane (2006, p. 95) for a critical perspective of the Holland’s definition of persistence.\n21. See Cunnigham (2001) for a taxonomy of emergence.\n22. The logical confusion emphasized by Hempel and Oppenheim (1948) refers to the fact that, for\nemergentists, emergent properties are not deducible from the micro ones. Hempel and Oppenheim\n(1948) explained that we cannot deduce properties. We can only deduce propositions in a formal\nlanguage from other propositions formulated in this same language. If a macro-proposition\n(theory explaining the whole) contains terms that are not terms of the micro-propositions (theory\nexplaining the parts) then of course it is impossible to deduce macro level from propositions from\nthe micro theory. In this perspective, the “whole” is not deducible from parts for purely logical\nreasons and then, the emergence is trivially not a deducible concept. Hempel and Oppenheim\n(1948) and, more recently, Stephan (1992) showed that the non-deducibility is always relative to\nthe proposition (i.e. to a specific formal language) used to characterize the micro and macro levels.\nThere is no absolute or ontological emergence as the classical emergentists claimed it.\n23. The expression “Bristish Emergentism” comes from McLaughlin (1992).\n24. There were also emergentists outside the British tradition: The American philosopher Sellars\n(1922) or the pragmatist tradition with James, Dewey and Mead - see Stephan (1992) for a\npresentation of these frameworks.\n25. Let us mention that Mill never used the term “emergence” which is attributed to the Philosopher\nof Science Georges Henry Lewes. However, in his work Problems of Life and Mind (1923), Lewes\nemphasized that this notion had been developed by J.S. Mill: “The concept of emergence was dealt\nwith (to go no further back) by J.S. Mill in his Logic (Bk.III. Chapter VI. §2) under the discussion of\n‘heteropathic laws’ in causation” (Sawyer, 2001, p. 553).\n26. Let us mention that novelty is not a necessary condition for emergence (see Francescotti, 2007, p. 49).\n27. Mill provided a dynamic view of emergence in which macro level of the system results from a\nnon-simple process between lower levels. By contrast with Mill, Alexander (1920) and Morgan\n(1923) proposed a more static view emergence that appears then a simple macro-empirical fact\n(O’Connor and Wong, 2005).\n28. This concept must not be confused with emergence that refers to a macro phenomenon whose\nresult appears to be more than the sum of components’ properties.\n29. Let us mention that the Millian idea of emergence is directly derived from chemistry and not from\nphysics. Physics was considered as the master discipline of science in which causality referred to\n177\nDuality of\nknowledge,\nsingularity of\nmethod\n', 'the sum of composing elements (i.e homopathic causality in Millian terms). In this perspective,\nchemistry appeared as the only field in which it was possible to observe a more complex\n(heteropathic) causality. This observation is not the case today since physics has been enlarged\nby sciences of complexity. That the reason for why we can study econophysics through a\nframework based on heteropathic causality.\n30. Whatever the definition of emergence (synchronic or diachronic emergence), this concept is based\non a downward causation (Francescotti, 2007).\n31. “There are problems with the notion of downward causation, notably that any causal chain from\nan emergent property E to some property P of the subunits (which subunits, you will recall, form\nthe ”base” B “‘generating” E) is underdetermined by the base itself, i.e. whenever there is E there\nis B (or something resembling B in terms of its causal powers and its ability to generate E-E being\nmultiply realizable), so whenever we say that E “downwardly causes” P we might just as well say\nB causes P and dispense with the notion of downward causation altogether.” (Rickles, 2007, p. 5).\nHowever, according to Hooker (2004) or O’Connor andWong (2006), this problem disappears once\nwe realize that emergence is a not a synchronic relationship between the subunits and the unit but\na dynamical process (and hence a diachronic relationship)” (Rickles, 2007, p. 5).\n32. In this statistical approach, agents are implicitly assumed heterogeneous because of the statistical\nmechanics models (Rosser, 2008, p. 15). It is worth mentioning that statistical physics is a broader\nfield than thermodynamics in which all properties of micro states are well defined (Roehner, 2002).\nEconophysicists mainly refer to the contemporary statistical physics in which microscopic states are\nnot necessary well known. While traditional thermodynamicists use statistics to describe the macro\nlevel resulting from the behaviors of a great numbers of defined microscopic states, econophysicists\nrather apply statistics in order to explain the behaviors of a lot of undefined micro states.\n33. The predictability in econophysics must be understood in a very specific way: macro laws are not\npredictive (i.e. deduced or anticipated) because they must be observed from empirical data. The\nonly thing statistical econophysicists are able to predict is that a statistical invariance will appear\nin specific complex systems but they are unable to predict the evolution of these complex\nsystems. Statistical econophysicists are not able to define a priori the emerging invariance\nwithout observing empirical data. In this perspective then this emerging invariance is not\npredictable since it always appears from a historical analysis of data.\n34. When the principles of political economy are to be applied to a particular case, then it is necessary\nto take into account all the individual circumstances of that case; not only examining to which of\nthe sets of circumstances contemplated by the abstract science the circumstances of the case in\nquestion correspond, but likewise what other circumstances may exist in that case, which not\nbeing common to it with any large and strongly-marked class of cases, have not fallen under the\ncognizance of the science. These circumstances have been called disturbing causes. And here only\nit is that an element of uncertainty enters into the process – an uncertainty inherent in the nature\nof these complex phenomena, and arising from the impossibility of being quite sure that all the\ncircumstances of the particular case are known to us sufficiently in detail, and that our attention\nis not unduly diverted from any of them.\n35. Because economic activity is interactive in essence, this perspective is more appropriate for\nunderstanding the connections between all parts of economic systems ( firms, banks, households).\nMoreover, all these elements can be seen as different structures having different characteristics in\nfunction of their “position” in the economic system or the kind of interaction they are submitted to.\n36. In physics, particles interact through a field which usually decline with distance according to a\nparticular inverse law.\n37. Each exchange needs a reciprocal situation and must have a particular duration.\n38. Epistemologically, econophysics is founded on the idea that statistical properties appear and\nreappear in many diverse phenomena but which can be expressed through a power law, as\nStanley et al. (1996, p. 288) express it: “It is becoming clear that almost any system comprised of a\nlarge number of interacting units has the potential of displaying power law behavior.\n178\nJABES\n25,1\n', 'Since economic systems are, in fact, comprised of a large number of interacting units has the\npotential of displaying power law behavior, it is perhaps not unreasonable to examine economic\nphenomena within the conceptual framework of scaling.”\n39. Indeed, even if they imply weak hypotheses (Mandelbrot and Hudson, 2004), scaling laws\nstatistically restricted the data. Under very general conditions, only three possible limiting\nbehaviors describe the categories of α:\n(1) There is a maximum value for the variable.\n(2) The distribution vanishes for values greater than this maximum and αo0. The tails\ndecay exponentially and 1/α¼ 0 (as normal distribution, for example).\n(3) There are fat tails that decay as a power law with αW0. Power laws used in econophysics\nare often characterized by a slow decay of probability mass in the tails of the distribution\n(that is the reason for why these distributions are known as “fat tailed”). These\ncharacteristics restrict the data since they must be in one of these three categories (and\nespecially the third if we want to describe a complex system with a power law). Another\nexample of restriction of data : the fact that power law with αW0 is not integrable at 0 and\nwith α⩽ 0, it is not integrable at infinity – that means that a power law distribution cannot\nbe exactly true for a variable with an unbounded range (Farmer, 1999, p. 29).\n40. This downward causation must not be confused with reducibility since the micro levels cannot be\ndeduced from the macro patterns but we know that the latter confer statistical properties to the first.\n41. We can draw an analogy between debates opposing economics and econophysics and the opposition\nbetween Mill and Bentham. Indeed, whereas Mill (econophysics) provided an empirical and inductive\napproach of knowledge, Bentham (economics) developed a more deductive framework based on an a\npriori (axiomatic) principles – for further information about this, see Akdere (2009).\n42. See Akdere (2008) for further information about the notion of “experimental heteropathic laws.”\n43. For concerning debates about these oppositions between economics and econophysics, see Lux\nand Ausloos (2002), Rosser (2005), Gallegati et al. (2006) and McCauley (2006).\n44. Although econometrics is sometimes presented as a positivist approach in economics, this positivist\ndimension in economics is overvalued from an epistemological perspective (Boland, 1997). See\nSchinckus (2010) for a detailed distinction between econometrics and statistical econophysics.\nReferences\nAlbin, P. and Foley, D.
