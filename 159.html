With the solem-\nnlty and reverence due to his holy\nj position \'and spotless character, the\nj body of Rev. Father Leo Heinrich tr.k\nI en from St. Elizabeth\'s church to the\nj union station, where It was placed\nI aboard a Burlington train to be for\n1 warded to Paterson, N. J., where the\n, Franciscan fathers have American\nheadquarters. The funeral procession\nwas a notable one and witnessed by\nthousands who stood bareheaded as\nthe cortege passed. The parade was\nled -by a squad of police, and a com\npany of Knights of St. John, in full\nuniform and with drawn swords, art\ned as a guard of honor. Knights of\nColumbus and representative" of nu\nmerous Catholic societies followed on\nfoot and a long string of cariajes\nbrought up the rear.\nWhen the services\' began in the\nchurch at 10 o\'clock, every available\nseat was filled and a crowd of 500\npersons waited patiently outside until\nthe church ceremony was over.\nInside the church were many promi\nnent citizens of Denver, including\nGovernor Buchtel, and Mayor Speer.\nSolemn high mass was celebrated and\nthe service was Impressive. Rev.\nFather William O\'Ryan delivered the\nfuneral sermon. He said In part:\nv-"That any serman Is attempted on\nthis solemn occasion is not because\nof Father Leo, the simply FraneJscan\nfriar, who is dead, nor even b cause\nof the high offense against the Al\nmighty Father of us all who live, but\nbecause of the society In which ve\nlive and Its outraged and loosened\nbond of law. Crimes such as that of\nlast Sunday are assaults on no mere\nIndividual; they are against you and\nme and all of us. They strike and\nwound law and justice In her holy\nsanctuary whence breathes the very\nlife of the civilized state.\nFather Leo was struck down, the\nmurderer confesses, because he was a\npriest, and not for any fancied griev\nance of Imagined Injury that the mur\nderer had received from him. He\nnever knew the dead priest; he had\nnever, spoken with him; their lives\nexcept in that one dread moment of\nblood and sacrilege had never to ir--ed.\nNor did he kill him, as priests\nhave been killed, In hatred of his\nspecial creed. But the fiend knew\nthat the priest was some outward\nsymbol and ambassador of that only\nauthority by which kings reign and\nmagistrates execute Justice and hu\nman law rears itself in awful dignity\nand finds it\'s sanction authority and\ngoverance of God. And because the\nmurderer had revolted against God\'s\nauthority, his rebellion went to its\nuttermost logical conclusion in action;\nhe revolted against Its presence In th\nworld of human law and broke It until\nit gushed human blood; he revolted\nagainst Its outward symbol, the priest,\nand slew him.\n"The murderer was logical. The\nanarchist is never truer to his diaboli\ncal principles than when he slays a\nCatholic priest and slays him at the\naltar of God. It matUrs not that the\nIndividual priest possesses little of the\nworld\'s power or goods, nor desires\nthem for himself; It matters not even\nthat he Is a follower of that blessed\nFranciscan who chose Lady Povt-rtv\nfor his bride and gave his great love\nto the poorest things and the most un\nloved. Wherever he is, the Catholic\npriest in some great way carries .i\nhimself that church of authority and\nof God and externalizes her to men\nHe is an officer in that great army\nwhose tramp has aroused the world:\nwhose desclpllne U most perfect:\nwhose organization Is most minutely\nretined ; whose banners are forever\nset against the enemy of disorder and\nanarchy In the heart, in the speech\nand In the action of men as opposed\nto Just human government and di\nvine rule\n"Yes. he was logical. He might hate\nthe ministers of other Christian bodies,\nbut not with similar hate the Im\npotent hate that slays, for they, alas,\nare too divided to be dangerous to\nhim. He might hate a king, for hr\nrules; but kings come and go; and\nkingly politics have their chances and\nchanges. But the aCtholic priest is\nslain but to live and the Catholic\npolicy, the Catholic accents of moral\nity are unchanged and unchangable\nas the throne of God.
