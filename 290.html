        <pre>['THE EUREKA SENTINEL.\nESTABLISHED 1870. EUREKA, NEVADA, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 23. 1907. PUBLISHED SATURDAYS.\nJames Nevin and the Governor\nCarson Correspondence to the Tonopah Son\nThere ia a story behind the bill vacat\niDg tbe offloe of State Bullion and\nLicense Collector, now held by James\nNevin.\nWhen tbe legislators were in Tono\npah, several railroad speeches were\nmade, but noDe caused as much com\nment as that of the Governor, who ar\nrived late and spoke against any legis\nlation against the railroads.\nNot ten boors before be bad advised\nit in Goldfield, and when he spoke as\nbe did a reason was sought. It is\nstated that his frieDd Jim Nevin was\nat the bottom of it aud that he has been\nat tbe bottom of every piece of vacilla\ntion which the Governor has indulged\nin.\nIn tbe face of the fact that the entire\npeople of the State demand some relief\nfrom the railroads, It is stated that\nNevin presumed to get in his flue work\naud iufluence the Governor, through\nthe latter’s desire to go to the United\nStates Senate two years from now,\nforcing Sparks to oppose railroad reg\nulation aud practically notifying every\nbody that he would veto a tu> asuie if\nthe legislators passed it. Anger is a\nmild word to express the feelings of\nthe men who came here from Touopah\nA caucus was called Wednesday\nnight and it was determined to roll the\nwagon over every man that gels in the\nway. The State Bullion Tax Collector\nis it, and he gels it first. Governor\nSparks will hardly dare to veto a rail\nreal regulation bill iu the face of tins\ndemonstration, aud it is hoped that now\nhe has been rebuked by the iauk and\nfile of bis owu party he will see a light\nand get back into line.\nNeviu is here, aud a big railroad\nlobby is here, bnt one aud all are feel\ning rather blue, in fact have been so\never since Wednesday night wbeu the\nretails of the caucus b -ratne evident.\nTbe bill introduced is as complete as\nweeks of preparation could make it.\nIt is believed (bat it is fair to both the\npeople aud the railroads. There is\nlittle question that it will pass the\nHouse with a rush, aud but one Senator\nso far has declared aguiust it, Woodbury\nof Oroisby.\nThere are all kinds of stories goin#\naround about muznma and boodle, bat\nPOETICAL LOCATION NOTICE\nBelow ia given what ia claimed to be\na bona fide copy of a location notice\npotted on a claim near Hoe bud. It\nclalrna about everything between heaven\nand the other place, and ia the prize\nnotioa on it aomeihiug can be ahowu to\nbeat it:\nWe the undersigned men of Worth,\nJnat to ahow that we\'re on the tnrf;\nDo hereby locate, (or onrtelvea alone.\nFifteen hun Ire 1 feet radina around this\natone;\nTogether with mineral aud water right*,\nAll placer lunda aud townaitea.\nAll veina aud ledgea within our liuea\nOf braaa or gold aud other rniuee.\nWe claim all coal and oil aa well\nFrom the top of the sagebruah down to\nhell;\nAll the air and euuehiue, too,\nUp to where the sky thinee bine.\nThe uame of thu claim ia the Wilton &\nGreen,\nNo. 403 aud group 10.\nFree Entry for Prospector*\nAlthough the bill which allows pros\npectors the right to go ou oufenoed\nground in search of the precious metsl\nwas one of the planks in the Republi\ncan platform at the last campaign, the\nmeasure received the heartiest support\nof the Democratic repvesmtatives when\na vote was takeu ou it in the Assembly\nlast week. The lower House records\n■how that there was not a dissenter in\nthe ranks of the Democracy against the\nbill. When the bill was iutrodnced\nSpeaker Skaggs took the floor in its\nfavor. He stut.d that the working\nuian, the miuer, has every right ou on\nfenced land, and that those who own\nsuch property do uot object, unless\nthey be corporations, inspired with\ngreed, for the poor owner knows thai\nhis other property will be iuoreased in\nvalue by the disoovery of riob tuiuerals.\nJudges and Lawyer Relatives\nCarson, City, Nev , Feb. 19—Governor\nSparks last wet k signed the measure\nwhich makes it unlawful for a judge to\ntry a case in which any relative of his\nto the sixth degree appears ae counsel\nfor either plaintiff or defendant. The\nbill was one of the first introdoced at\nthis sossiou of the Legislature, and it\nwas fathered by Senator Boyd. The in\ncentive for presenting the measure was\ngained in Washoe County when, during\nthe term of offloe of District Judge\nOnrlur, the father of the man ou the\nbeuch, was cue of the most frequeut\npractitioners. Ofteu when a case was\nlost by an attorney, the father of the\nJudge appearing us conusel for the win\nning party in the action, the inference\nwas made that the Judge had been\npartial.\nRailroad Day at Searchlight\nRailroad day will be celebrated in\nSearchlight, Liucolu County, ou March\n1. The Santa Fe line is now completed\nfor 10 miles and the remainder of eight\nmiles will be laid and in working order\ntu two weeks. The railroad officials\nstate that they will have passenger aud\nfreight trains ruuniug in there ou\nscheduletime.\nnone of them »re belivetl. In the pres\nent temper of most of the members of\nthe Legislature it would be rather dan\ngerous to offer them a bribe, and\nBlakeslee has never been known in\nthis State for bis courage.\nThe members are reading with great\nglee the reports of the Lane investiga\ntion at Los Aogeles. and to gay that\nthis came at a most opportune moment\nis putting it mildly. These reports\nsimply crystalized the gentimeut that\nno railroad promises can be relied upon,\nand when it wag shown that Whittfc\nmore was unable to keep a single one\nof bis promises there was a loud guf\nfaw from everybody and the bill was\ndemanded.\nThe fight is on. There is nothing\nto it in the Honse, but iu the Senate\nthere may be a deadlock or a delay or\nsomething that will destroy the good\neffect of the bill.\nSpeaker Skagge Leading the Fight\nThe bill to oust Bullion Tax Collector\nNeviu by abolishing his office has\ncaused him to ruu around iu circles,\nlie is buttonholing every man he can\ng\' t to lisien to him, but gets little satis\nfaction, for the whole House is sore\nwith a big S, aud Nevin is up against\nit. The Speaker said to day:\n“It is true that I am b\'-hind that bib.\nI beln vo i bat inasmuch as Kevin has\ndone the best work for the railroads,\nthe railroads should pay him. He\'s a\nfifth wheel anyhow and the Gran I Jury\nof my county had to ca 1 attention to\nhis lack of dil.geuce. As a matter ot\nfact be is only kept iu office by the rail\nroads aud it is time die railroads be.\ngan to pay him aud the State cut him\noff ”\nThis seutimeut finds an echo iu nearly\nevery member of the House. Keviu is\nblamed for the Governor\'s flop at Touo\npah aud for g ver.il similar fl ips by the\nGovernor. The Governor made the\nstatement Wednesday night that be\nstands by bis Tonopuh declaration. If\nhe stauds by that declaiation during\nthe session it is almost a cinch that he\nis a political dead one from this time\nforth, for the peop e of Nevada demand\nsome regulation of railroads aud will\nhave it, aud woe tobim that gets iu the\nway.\nBRIEF ANO BREEZY PARAGRAPHS\nAccording to the President\'* ultima\ntum. the Slates must regulate child\n1 tbor or the Big Sti<,k will.\nSwetteubam has resigned, but It will\ntake more than au earthquake to shake\nPlatt and D>pew from tbeir perch.\nThe trouble with Senator LaFollette\nit that he Introduces such good bills the\nSenators are afraid to punish him by\nvoting against them.\nThe sensationalist* who Insist on the\nUuited States going to war with Japan\nire about 10,000 milt* from where the\nsbootiug could begiu.\nMr. Bryau it engaged to deliver 86\nlectures at $500 per.

Lane, who shot Ollie K»-n\nnlbuugh throogh the head at Amargosa\nou Feb. 4, has been exonerated from the\nkilling upon a plea of self-defense Iu\nthe preliminary examination, which\nwus held at Rhyolite, it appeared that\nlveiinibaugh was a gun mau with a bad\nrecord, even for the southwest. Had the\ncase gone against him in the prelimi\nnary examination, the attorneys for the\ndefense would have attempted to prove\nthat Keuuilaugh was noue other than\nHert Aivord, the Uuite t States Deputy\nMarshal, who held up a train ou the\nrtock Island durtug his term of office,\naud was set to work by the Federal of\nficials to arrest and couvict himself,\nt he Aivord case is more than five years\nold, and during that time a price has\nbeen upon Alvord\'a head.\nMinin?

The\nbill was fathered by Senator Martin.\nI The entire cost of the mansion for Dr.\n; Stnbbs was $9,439.05. Of this sum the\nUniversity President gave $3,994.

He also s\'ates that it will\nt ost the city of Reno more than $300,000\nto change the sewer system iu Reuo and\nwill practically bankrupt the city.\nThe Coal at Coaldale\nH. C. Hartzboru, a coal miner of\nCoaldale, was interviewed by a Touopah\nSun reporter recently According to bis\nreports the coal at the Coaldale district\ncouststs of a vein varying from 16\ninches to 16 feet in thickness. While\nMr. Hartzboru is an experienced coal\ninau, he said be never before saw\n-uch peculiarities as exist iu the vein at\nCoaldale. The coal, according to Mr.\nIlartzhorn, is coking coal, and for that\nreason it is difficult to burn, although\nit is expeoted that ihe quality will be\ncome better as the development of the\nvein gets deeper. At that it is as good\nas some of the coal that hag been re\nceived in Tonopah of late.\nPantaloon\'s Choice.\nUlysses and King Solomon. Prince Parts,\nRuy Cld,\nWere mighty persons.

WHITMORE\n-A. GHENT\nEureka, - Nevada\nNo More Fuel Famine\nIn the con-ent issue of tbe Review of\nReviews is an interesting and nsefnl\narticle on a substitute for coal as fuel\nand the success achieved in the nse ol\ndenatured alcohol in Germany and Hol\nland. The author, Charles Baskewille,\npoints out that in these two countries\nTO per cen of the stoves are fed with\ndenatured alcohol. Potatoes, stsrcb,\ncorn or any cereal; sorghum, beet-root,\nresidues, cornstalks, frnits of various\nkinds, melons, gourds, cactus, honey,\nmilk, etc., contaiu the eleme its neces\nsary to produce this fnel, and as shown\nin tbe article quoted, the process of dis\ntillation is very simple. A million gal\nlons of denatured alcohol are used annu\nally in Germany as a fuel for internal\ncombustion, engines and for driving\nagricultural and other machinery, thus\nrelieving the demand upon coal for this\npurpose. It is also used extensively as\nan illuminant, relieving again the pres\nsure upon coal for the manufacture of\ngas while the point urged by the\neconomist is that it may be made in the\nUnited State*, as it is made in Germany,\nfrom the waete product! of the farm\naud orchard.\nThe question of producing denatured\nalcohol from the things that would\notherwise go to waste and applying the\nproduct to the needs of ordinary life as\nexpressed in a substitute for ooai in do\nmestic use is its absolute cleanliness.\nThis means that the labors of house\nkeeping in the winter season would be\nreduced at least one-half and that of\nstoking furnaces and stoves would he\nentirely abolished. The householder\nwho attends to his own furnace, shovel\ning into it from five to SO tons of ooal\nduring the winter, according to the\nlooality, and the housekeeper who\nwrestles for months with ooal dust and\nsmoke will appreciate to the foil a clean\nsubstitute for this sooty king who has\nlong held court in the domestio realm.\nTHIS BROWN HOTEL\nThis hotel has changed hands and is now under new management.\nThe house will be conducted as a first-class Family Hotel and\nevery attention will be paid to the comfort of guests.\nMR8.

FEBRUARY 28. 1907.\nSCHOOL CHILDREN ROBBED\nThe Text-Book law has passed the\nCalifornia Assembly. It provides for\nthe furnishiug of free text books to all\nthe pnpils attending public schools in\nCalifornia. The measure enacts that at\nthe next general election the Board of\nSupervisors of each oounty shall submit\nto the voters the question of supplying\nthe free use of school text books. If a\nmajority of the votes cast on the propo\nsition shall be in favor of the Act, the\nSupervisors shall, at the time of fixiug\nthe next annual tax rate, fix a rate that\nwill be sufficient revenue to raise the\nsnm estimated as the cost of furnishing\nthe books.\nThis is another step on the part of the\nState of California to give her citizens\na reasonable return for the educational\ndollar. Every pupil in the pnblic\nschools should be provided with free\ntext-books. Nevada has failed thus far\nnot only to take this step, but her peo\nple are required to pay nearly three\ntimes as much for the text-books nsed\nin the schools of this State as the same\nbooks cost in other States. Nobody\nclaims that we have a superior quality\nof school books. They are the same as\nthose being used in other States.\nBefore the present Legislature closes\nthe consideration of public school\nmatters it should take up the text-book\nproblem and enact for the State of Ne\nvada a contract text-book law which\nwill relieve our people of this worse\nthan needless burden. A set of ordin\nary school books for a pupil in this\nState costs over $13, while the same\nset of books can be bought by any per\nson in Indiana for a little over $5.\nThe idea that every child in our great\nState must make this contribution to\nthe most heartless trust on the face of\nthe earth before he can enter one of\nour public schools is preposterous. Be\nfore this question, even the agitation\nfor a reduction of the exhorbitant rail\nroad rates in this State fades into ob\nscurity. No subject can be closer to the\nhearts of the people than the education\nof our youth, and oertainly no greater\nobstacle can be placed in the way of\nadvancement in our public schools than\nthe present text book law now affords.\nHow much longer will our representa\ntives at Carson require us to submit to\nto this injustice ?\nAny person can procure a copy of the\nschool laws of Indiana by sending 14\ncents to the Superintendent of Public\nInstruction, Indianapolis, Indiana.\nThe resolution recently introduced in\nthe Nevada Legislature by Assembly\nman Tigbe making it a misdemeanor\nfor any paid lobbyist to enter the Capi\ntol building to ply his vocation was\npassed unanimously by the Assembly.\nIt has had the desired effect. This is a\nmove in the right direction, and will be\na strong safeguard for the people’s in\nterests, as well as a means of protection\nfor the legislators themselves.\nNON-UNION MINERS DRIVEN OUT\nJ. V. Miller and Dan Gray Forced\nto Leave New Mining Camp\nVernon, Humboldt County, Nevada,\nFeb. 18.—There are to be no scabs in\ncamp. This verdict was rendered Sun\nday evening by the acting committee\nof some 30 members of the camp. The\ngentlemen in question were J. P. Miller\nand Dan Gray, both of Cripple Creek.\nThey came to the camp on the Friday\nbefore, set up their tent and, it is re\nported, were working at Seven Troughs\nfor $3 00 per day.\nGray acknowledged bis vocation and\nadmitted that he had never belonged to\nthe Union. He has been a deputy\nsheriff in Cripple Creek and moved\nhere on the recommendation of friends.\nBoth gentlemen were unable to pro\nduce the required union card, though\nMiller had a dubious looking pastboard\nthat called for “probation” and pleaded\nfor its being honored, bnt the committee\ncould not accept it on such conditions.\nThey are now out of the camp, having\nbeen escorted to Lovelock on the fol\nlowing morning.\nIt is the desire of the camp to have\nit known that no scabs are allowed\nhere, and those not having the correct\ncredentials will not be allowed to re\nmain. It will save some trouble, per\nhaps even more, if all miners coming\nin will understand that olear cards only\nwill be honored.\nMiuers’ Union Joins I. W.

Are they not\nhauling freight and passengers at the\ncheapest rates ever known ? Are they\nnot doing more than any other single\nagency to build up the country ?” Why,\nthen, should a "little coterie of politi\ncians, appointed by the President” su\npervise and harass aud ooeroe the group\nof philanthropic capitalists whose sole\ndesire is to be let alone to manipulate\nand scheme the money of the people\ninto their capacious coffers ?\nThe answer is a simple one, says the\nSan Francisco Recorder. Because, if\nallowed to contiuue as they have been\ndoing for the last quarter of a century,\nthey would soon be greater than the\npeople, as, in point of capitalizition,\nthey are richer than the Government.\nBecause the people have seeu their\nLegislatures purchased, their city\ncouncils bribed, their officials debauch\ned and the law defied by the railroads\nuntil patience has ceased to be a virtue\nand the time has come to say who\nshall role, the people or the railroads.\nThis is no new thing, this agitation\nagainst the transportation companies.\nMen have cried out against their every\nagression, but often their cry has fallen\nupon deaf ears; or having been heeded,\nthe reforms they sought to bring about\nhave been defeated by the agency of\nthose whose wrongdoing they sought\nto curb.\nThis outcry has not been against the\nrailroads as such, for no one will gain\nsay that the railroads have been one of\nthe greatest agencies of civilization and\ndevelopment the world has ever known\nbut against the railroad’s pursuit of\nspecial privileges and the unscraplous\nmeans they employed to obtain them.\nThe outcry has not been in vain; the\n"voices in the wilderness” have been\nheard and there counsel is being fol\nlowed. Each year sees the enactment\nof new legislation, in some cases radi\ncal, in others conservative, but all tend\ning to the one end, and that is, making\nthe railroads—the "oommon carriers”—\nwhat they should be, the servants, not\nthe masters of the people.\nWhenever railroad reforms are\nbroached, the plea is always made that\nthe holders of the stocks and bonds are\nof the people—widows and orphaus,\nand comfortable citizens; but how\nmuch voice have they in the manage\nment of the roads? They have as little\ninfluence in affairs as a man might\ngain by shouting down a well. The\ncontrol is in the manipulators, who, as\nin the case of the Southern and Union\nPacific, rigged the stock market so that\nthey could secure more stock, and then,\nhaving acquired it,boosted the dividends\nto their own great personal advantage.\nIt is small wonder, then, that, with\nthe remembrance of this, and the coal\nlands deal, and th6 railroads\' fight\nagainst safety devices, and their de\nbauchery of officials and flouting of the\nlaw, that the agitation continues, not\nfor the purpose of hampering their ef\nficiency, but with the object of curbing\ntheir rapacity and securing to the peo\nple some share in the benefits accruing\nfrom their existence.\nBUTTE SITUATION SERIOUS\nLabor Unions Join Organized\nMovement for an Increased\nScale of Wages\nBntte, Montana, Feb. 20.—The far\nreacbing strike in Bntte was spread this\nmorning by a notice served on all em\nployers of a raise by the Bntte Work\ningmen\'s Union. This organization,\nthe largest in the city of the trades,\nembracing laborers of every de\nscription, including Btreet sweepers,\nditch diggers, shovelers, etc., and\nits members have been getting $3 per\nday in Butte. Their new scale as an\nnounced to-day will take effect March 1\nand calls for $3.50 per day. The oity of\nButte is most heavily affected, bnt a\nnumber of other industries will suffer.\nMany employers will refuse the de\nmands.\nThe crisis in the situation draws near.\nThe Mriners* Union will vote next Mou\nday on the proposition to increase the\nscale from $3.76 to $4 per day.\nA shut down would cut 20,000 men\noff the pay rolls.\nNews Summary\nTha trial of Abe Reuf, the San Fran\ncisco boss under indictment for extor\ntion, began Monday.

It is not due to Mr. Har\nrimau’s genius as a railroad man, but to\nthe general public creating new traffio\nowing to the country\'s prosperity.

While the device is splendidly\nsuccessful for reducing expenses, it\nusually means that the freight does not\nmove until enough of it has accumulat\ned to make up a big train load, hence it\nis often delayed, rendering the device\nby no means so popular with the ship\npers as it is with the stockholders.\nThe average freight rate per ton per\nmile on lowest grade ore in the State\nof Nevada is 2.375 cents, while witboui\nthe State it is only 1.125 cents.\nFrom such data as is at hand it ap\npears that the average commodity rate\non shipments from Chicago to San\nFrancisco per mile per hundred pounds\nis six-tenths of a mill, while from Chi\ncago to Reno, 244 miles of mountain\nhauling nearer, it is nine-tenths of a\nmill, or 331^\' per cent higher, and the\nlocal rate in Nevada is nine mills or ten\ntimes as much as on the through haul.\nThese figures are more significant when\ncompared with the average freight rate\nPER TON per mile prevailing on the\nUnion Pacific Railroad, which is a\nlittle more than 9 mills per 2000 pounds\nas against nine mills per 100 pounds in\nNevada.\nFigures are at present in preparation\ncomparing the average rates in Nevada\nwith that of other States, Nevada to\nday is struggling harder than any other\nState in the Union, its wealth and\npopulation have trebled within the\npast three years.

Fewson Smith Tells About the\nEfficacy of Earns\' Invention\nSalt Lake Herald: J. Fewson Smith,\nJr., has recently returned from a trip to\nColorado, where he went to witness the\npractical operation of the Earns tunnel\ning machine. He said:\n“The object of my trip was to inspect\nthe mechanical structure and witness\nthe operation of the constructed machine\nat the Iudia mine near Boulder, Colo.\n“In structure, the machine is so\nsimple as to be absolutely incapable of\nderangement through operation, there\nbeing but two wearing parts, the driv\niug face and the bearings, and these\neasy of access and quick of replacement\n"In operation it is surprisingly ef\nfective. In spite of many defects in\npreparation and manipulation, it hewed\nits own passage through solid rock at\nthe rate of five feet per hour during the\ntime it was being run for our benefit.\n“The moyles or cutters used on this\noccasion had already cut out some 40\nfeet of tunnel and looked good for con\nsiderable service yet.\n“The rock in which the machine is\nworking is an impure granite, possibly\nno harder than some of our limestone\nor quartzite, but of such hardness as\nsubjects the machine to a severe test.\nIt stood up bo well under the test that I\nam firmly convinced that the machines\nwill easily perform the service expected\nof them.”\nAnythin? from Nevada Goes\nAnything from Nevada that has a\nsagebrush scent hanging to it, goes now\nin New York.

Five mining companies are\nmaking extensive preparations for open\ning np large mines in that district this\nSpring.\nThe Copper Basin Mining & Smelting\nCompany bus bank aud boarding nccom\nmodaiions for about 100 men built and\nunder construction, aud has beeu em\nploying betweed 40 and 60 men for\nseveral mouths in developing tbe Skaggs\nproperty, on which the first payment\nwas made about a month ago. Two 10\nanimal teams are bringing in materials\nto be nsed in furthering the work. This\ncompany has exteuded the old tunnel\nabout 100 feet, and has run another tun\nnel below it nearly 300 feet. Cross cuts\nhave beeu mode to a considerable\nlength, aud all of the workings show a\ntine body of high grade copper ore. The\nwork is now being poshed as rapidly as\npossible.\nThe ground which was recently in\ncorporated by Burke and Ryan, believed\nlo be working for Thomas Lawson,\nshows a good quality of lead ore ou the\nsnrface. Nine or ten meu are now\nworking ou this property, and the com\npany expects to put on more men as\nsoon us Spring opens. T. R Oddie of\nTonopah lias six men working on bis\nground, and also expects to increase the\nnumber soon. Other parties are de\nveloping their ground as fast as the\nwe itlier will permit, and all of them ex\npect to increase the force of men em\nployed as fast as the conditions will\nwarrant their doing so. .\nThe upper camp shows fine copper\nbodies which are said to be jnst\nas promising as those at Ely ever were\nThe lower camp shows gome copper, bat\nis rich iu gold ; some of thu assays on\nthe Wingfield-Nixon property going as\nhigh as $300 per ton.\nA good mauy claims have beeu bonded\nin both of the camps, and the first pay\nments will be made about the first of\nMay, when active development work\nwill be greatly extended.

The railroad iuto\nEly can a\'so be reached at a point about\ntbe same distance from the upper camp.\nThis will give a good outlet for the pro\nduct and inlet for supplies, and there is\nplenty of wa’er on the ground.

It is\nsimply calliug attention to conditions\nthat need to be reformed. In these days\nthere is an especial need of emphasizing\nthe teaching of respect for law aud\norder and the enforcement of the same.\nWhile most gratifying progress has\nbeeu made iu higher education, and the\nattendance at high schools, colleges and\nuniversities has greatly increased, dis\norderly conduct upon the part of\nstudeuts, in mauy of these schools, has\nbecome a detrimeut aud a disgrace.\n“Too many people view the lawless\nconduct of students as boyish pranks,\nand, although damage is often done to\npersou or property, these acts are treated\nas jokes; aud, as a result, many boys\nget the idea that, while In school and\ncollege, they must commit a number of\nreokless deeds iu order to distinguish\nthemselves aud make themselves appear\nlarge in the eyes of their acquaintances\naud fellow studeuts. Boys can have a\ngood time without violating law.\n“The very disorderly element in our\nschools is probably confined to a small\nper cent of the total number of students;\nbut this c\'ass is much too large and out\nbreaks aud depredations by studeuts fur\ntoo frequent, aud the influence of such\nconduct is so hurtful that vigorous aud\nprompt action is needed to suppress all\nsuch lawlessness. The school authorities\nthat are trying to maiutain good order\namong student bodies deserve the hearty\nsupport of law-abiding citiseus. This\nbad conduct should be stopped, and it\ncan be stopped. Institutions are not\nestablished aud maintained for the edu\ncation of “hoodlums” and violators of\nlaw. Youug men should behave iu\nschool or be expelled. This lawlessness\nshould be stopped, eveu if it takes a\nforce of police and detectives to accom\nplish it.”\nDeath of Ada Leyshou\nAda Leyshou, aged 16 years, died of\nspiual meningitis iu Salt Lake City on\nJau. 31, 1907.

So he\nsent the following message to-day to\nthe Assembly:\n“To the Honorable, the Assembly,\nGentleman:—I have the honor to re.\ntorn to your honorable body witbont\nmy approval Assembly Joint and Con\ncurrent Resolution relative to railroad\npasses. My objection to this resolution\ncan ba briefly stated: It is too far\nreaching in its application, and will In\nterfere with private business. If Its\nprovisions were confined to strictly of\nficial matters it would not be objection\nable. Members of the Legislatnre and\nmany of the State officers are men of\nbusiness entirely disconnected with his\nofficial duties. This resolution carries\nwith it an implied insult to the integ\nrity and character of men in whom\nthe people of this State have had snf\nficent confidence to elect to high and\nJOHN’ SPARKS\nresponsible positions, and it does not\nseem to tne reasonable or just that they\nshonld be placed in the light of sus\npicion concerning their official acts.\n"In business it frequently happens\nthat the shipper desires to accompany\nhis freight to market, and especially\nthe case in the shipmnt of lire stock.\nRailroads usually tender the owner and\nattendants free passage in going and\nreturning, and should it be possible to\nenforce this resolution itwould work\nan injury to a class of citisens engaged\nin private business and amount to\nnothing more than an incumberence of\nthe record. “Respectfully,\n"JOHN SPARKS,\n"Governor of Nevada.”\nSpeaker Skaggs declared that in veto\ning a resolution the executive branch of\nthe Government was seeking to invade\nthe rights of the legislative branch and\nthat the action of the Governor was\nwholly unconstitutional. The Assem\nbly could not reconsider the resolution,\nSpeaker Skaggs held, and all that\ncould be done was to refer the message\nto the Committee on Judiciary, which\naction was taken.\n"Governor Sparks had no more right\nto veto the Huskey resolution regarding\nthe acceptance of railroad passes than\nthe gergeaut at arms,” said Speaker\nSkaggs. "He merely did this to express\nin strongest terms to the Senate and\nAssembly his attitude on probable rail\nroad legislation. The Governor\'s ex\ncuse may be that a resolution is the\nsame as a bill and subject in that sense\nto his veto should he disapprove. But\nwhil > the constitution of the United\nStates makes such a provision in regard\nto bills in Congress, the same section of\nthe constitution provides that the House\nof Representatives and Senate can pass\na bill over the President\'s veto. No\nsuch provision is made, however, in the\nState constitution. Iu this way a reso\nlution is not the same as a bill in either\nof the Houses of the State goverumeut.”\nBargains in Shoes\nMen’s Dress and Working Shoes re\nduced 50 cents and 75 cents per pair.\nMen’s High-Cut Prospector’s Shoes\nreduced from |0 to 94.50.\nA general reduotiou iu prices has been\nmade throughout our stock of Ladies’\nand Children’s Shoes at\nMau Bros Eureka, Nevada. *\nAlways keep a bott\'e of I.

The proposed law provides that\nemployees engaged in the haudliag of\ntrains shall not work more than six\nteen consecutive hours, followed by ten\nhours off duty. Exception to the work\ning of the rule Is made in the case of\ndelay from accidents. The enforce\nment of the law Is placed In the bands\nof the federal ceurts and the Inter\nstate commerce commission. It was\nthis body which discovered In connec\ntion with Its Investigation of the re\ncent Terra Cotta (District of Columbia)\nwreck that an engineer of the road\nconcerned had worked thirty-six hours\nwithout rest, and the general manage:\nof the road admitted that accidents ol\nten took place as the result of men no,\nhaving sufficient time to rest.\nDuring his speech In advocacy of the\nbill in the senate Its author read for\nBn hour from official reports of railway\nAccidents Involving many deaths. In\none Instance of as many as fifty-three\npassengers and In other cases result\ning In the slaughter of trainmen, aud\nIn every case It was shown that the\nemployees responsible for what bad\noccurred had been on duty from twen\nty-two to forty hours at a stretch.\nHaving won bis fight on the railroad\nbill, the Wisconsin member has now\ntaken up another task, and this, too,\nhas to do with railroads and is certain\nto meet vigorous opposition from them.\nIt Is expected that they will line up\nAgainst It with the same sort of tac\ntics that were used against the rate\nbill. Under the provL-\'^ns of the pro\nposed law the secretary of the Interior\nIs charged with supervision of the min\neral and coal deposits and the licenses\nand royalties, although minimum roy\nalties are stipulated. Speaking of Its\nobjects. Senator La Follette says:\n“The bill follows the Hues of the\nmost advanced legislation which has\nbeen enacted by other countries for\nthe conservation of their fuel supplies.\nThe object sought to be attained is to\nretain in the government the title to all\nminerals upon or under the public do\nmain which are or can be used for fuel\n* or lighting purposes. At the same time\nIt alms to preserve to bona fide settlers\nAdd under terms that are as liberal as\nthe present luws the right to acquire\nagricultural and grazing lauds, so that\nthe withdrawal of more than 50,000,000\nacres of land from entry and sale will\nnot In any way retard the growth and\nprogress of the agricultural and graz\ning Industries in the west.**\nA Hard Hit.\n“So you won\'t tell who gave you\nyour new ball?”\n“No. I heard mamma say never to\ntell you anything because you couldn’t\nkeep It.”—Chicago American.\nHARRY K. THAWS SISTER.\nPittsburg Hsirsss and Beauty Who Is\nNow Countasa of Yarmouth.\nThe Countess of Yarmouth, who\neame to America to attend the trial of\nher brother, Harry K. Thaw, for the\nkilling of the architect. Stanford\nWhite, was Mins Alice Thaw, and her\nmarriage on April 27, 1W1B, at her\nmother’s home In Pittsburg to the Earl\nof Yarmouth was one of the leading\nsociety topics of the year.\nAccording to some authorities. It was\nHarry Thaw himself who brought\nabout the marriage between his sister\nand Oeorge Francis Alexander Sey\nmour, earl of Yarmouth and eldest son\nand heir of the Marquis of Hertford.\nA.\nTHE COUNTESS OP YARMOUTH.\nAt any rate, In a signed statement is\nsued after the nuptials the young man\nnow on trial for his life wrote:\n“It Is a great union—a uulou between\none of the oldest families of England\nand one of the most prominent families\npf the United States, If t do say It my\nself, l am delighted. 1 feel like a boy\nout of school. An earl Is my brother\nin-law. Why shouldn’t I be glad?"\nThe earl bad a good many tlnauclal\ntroubles in tills country prior to bis\nmarriage to Miss Thaw. Tailors, land\nlords and other creditors put blm\nthrough some rather embarrassing ex\nperiences, But a big marriage settle\nment went with bis bride, and it has\nproved a very convenient asset In\nkeeping up the family estates In Bng\nlnnd. Mrs. William Thaw at first op\nposed her daughter’s marriage to the\npari and sent her away to Florida to\nget her out of the vicinity of the Eng\nlish lord. The latter pursued her tQ\nthe sunny southland, on n tip from\nHarry, it Is said, and Anally the obdu\nrate parent was won over.\nMARLOWE AS SALOME.\n"Dance of the Seven Veils” In the Plsjf\n“John the Baptist.”\nThere has been much discussion as\nto the morality of Itichard Strauss’\nmusic drama “Salome" as presented\nat the Metropolitan Opera House and\nof the stage version of the work, “John\nthe Baptist," as produced by Julia\nMarlowe and E- H. Botheru at the\nLyric theater, New York. A sensational\nJULIA MARLOWE AS SALOUS.\nfeature of the piece lu either the dra\nmatic or operatic production is the\n“Dance of the Seven Veils," by which\nthe seductive Salome, makes so great\nan impression upon Ilerod that be\nconsents to give her the head of St.\nJohn the Baptist on a charger. Miss\nMarlowe, who in the Lyric theater pro\nduction takes the part of Salome, has\nsurprised her admirers by the success\nwith which she performs this difficult\nspecialty. In her interpretation of the\nrole of Salome she exhibits Jealousy\nbordering on insanity, sweetly simple\ngirlishness, cruelty like that of a starv\ning lioness and naive Ingenuousness.\nHow Opium Is Obtained.\nOpium is obtained by cutting the\ncapsule of the poppy flower with a\nnotched Iron instrument at sunrise,\nand by the next morning a drop or so\nof Juice has oozed out. This is scraped\noff and saved by the grower, and, after\nbe has a vessel full of It, it Is strained\nand dried. It takes a great many pop\npies to make a pound of opium, and it\ngoes through a number of processes\nbefore it Is ready for the market. In a\nliquid state it looks like dark straw\nberry Jam.\n1 In a Sleeper\njto Cuba\'s Coast\nTHERE Is considerable talk ns\nto whether or no the political\ntie between Cuba and the Unit\ned States should be made\ncloser. But. whatever the outcome of\nthis discussion, the Island will soon be\nconnected with this country very close\nly in a physical sense. This will come\nabout through the completion of the\nrailroad now building from Miami,\nFla., to Key West. With the finishing\nof this remarkable piece of railway\nconstruction It will be possible to travel\nfrom New York to Havana without\nleaving the Pullman, aud the Cuban\ncapital will tie to all Intents and pur\nposes ns near to the boundaries of our\nrepublic as If an earthquake like that\nwhich recently shook up the neighlior\nlng Island of Jamaica had struck Cuba,\ntoo, and shoved It northward and west\nward a few leagues toward the coast\nof Florida. When the uew road is com\npleted there will be a continuous nil\nrail line from New York to Key West,\nthe most southerly port of the United\nStates, and as the distance from Key\nWest to Havnnn Is only ninety miles,\nthe water part of the trip will be ac\ncompllshed by train boats.\nThis Important development In traus\nportation facilities Is due to the energy\nand enterprise of the Standard Oil mul\ntlmllllonaire Henry M. Flagler, who\nhas been said to own half of Florida.\nThis statement may be an exaggera\ntion, but he certainly owns a great\ndeal of the state ami has spent mil\nlion after million m building railroads,\nhotels, palatial residences, etc., and in\ndeveloping the state In numerous ways.\nAt seventy-six he Is still vigorous and\nambitious, and as he conies of a long\nlived family he looks forward to Rome\nyears of activity yet before acknowl\nedging himself too old to work. His\nfather, a Presbyterian minister, who\nbrought up a good sized family on a\nsalary of #4<t0 a year, lived to his\neighty-eighth year, aud all the clergy\nman\'s twelve brothers and sisters sur\nvived to a good old age. When Mr.\nBBNBY M PLAOLIll AND THK HABDOB OP\nKEY WEST.\nFlagler married for a third time a year\nor two after reaching threescore and\ntan he gave a present of $4,01)0,000 to\nfils bride and $50,000 each to her father\nadd mother. Some people put b>m In\nthe $100,000,000 class. He has been\nbuilding railroads and otherwise devel\noping Florida for a good many years.\nHe and the late H. B. Plant have link\ned their names with the state’s prog\nress.\nA story Is told of the days when\nthese two men were friendly rivals. To\nFlagler fell the east coast, with Miami\nas his southernmost point, from which\na line of steamers ran to Cuba. Plant’s\nsouthern termluus was Tampa, from\nWhich a similar line ran to Havana.\nTo Plant one day—so story has It—\nFlagler sent the following Invitation by\nwire)\nHenry B. Plant, New York City:\nCan\'t you pay me a visit at Miami?\nH. M. FLAGLER.\nAgd straightway came the reply:\nH. M. Flagler, St Augustine, Fla.:\nAccept with much pleasure, but where\non earth Is Miami? H. B. PLANT.\nIu answer to this Flagler sent the\nfollowing directions to his friend:\nTo Henry B. Plant, New York City:\nFollow the cpowd.\nH M. FLAGLER.\nWhen the Key West extension of the\nFlorida East Coast railway, Mr. Flag\nler’s road, la completed the sea voyage\nOCi the trip from New York to Havana\nwill be reduced by taking this route to\nabout three hours. The new develop\nment will mean much for the future of\nKey West, the nearest port of the Unit\ned States to the coming Panama canal.\nThe Key West extension will be 126\nmiles in length, and, while this Is not\nlong as modern railways go, the con\nstruction of the line promises to rank\nas an engineering achievement of Im\nportance, as much of the distance Is\nover the opeu aea and part Is through\nthe deep mud of the Everglades. Only\nabout sixty-five miles of the extension\nis to be built on natural foundation.\nThe rest of the line must depend for\nsupi>ort on bridges, viaducts, dredged\nembankments aud filled In swamps\nAbout thirty Islands are made use of\nIn the building of the line, and about\nfive miles of It run over great con\ncrete arches resting on piers rising\nout of water from ten to thirty feet In\ndepth. On this part of the route the\nfuture traveler may well Imagine that\nhe is going to Cuba by railroad across\ntfcu oceaR._\nHU Pari.\nLittle Jack—What did papa mean by\nsaying that he was captain of this ship?\nMa—Oh, that is only bis way of say\ning that he Is the head of the bouse.\nLittle Jack—Then, If pa is the cap\ntain, what are you?\nMa—Well, I suppose I am the pilot\nLittle Jack-Oh, yes, and then I must\nbe the compass?\nMa—The compass.\' Why the compass?\nLittle Jack—Why, the captain and\npilot are always boxing the compass,\nyou know.\n—\nOblivion la the rule and fame the ex\nception of humanity.—Ui varot\nRACY MRS. ATHERTON.\nTVs Brilliant Author\'* Reply to an\nEnglish Editor\'s Offer.\nSo many people In England swear\nby the London Times that when Ger\ntrude Atherton, the California novelist,\ntold Its editor that he might ‘‘go to the\ndevil” her boldness caused a sensation,\nto put It mildly, in British literary cir\ncles. Mrs. Atherton, who Is a great\ngrandniece of Benjamin Franklin, Is\naccustomed to making daring flights In\nAction, and a departure from the con\nventional In the use of language is\nright In her line. There had been a\nrontroversy in the Times’ book de|>art\nGERTRUDE ATHERTON,\nment over the price at which the au\nthor’s latest novel, "Rezanov,” has sold\nIn England, and the editor had offered\nto publish k at 2 shillings Instead of (1,\nthe present price. It sells In the United\nStates for 50 cents. The Times editor\nthought It would bring the novelist\nlarger royalties If also sold In England\nat a cheaper price. Mrs. Atherton dual\nly wrote to the London Journal\'s head:\n“With my publisher. Murray, I will\nremain as long ns he will have me and\nfyerpby Invite you and all your subordi\nnates in my second best Californiaese\nto go to the devil. I am sick of the\nwhole controversy and am too busy\nWith my new book to bother with you\nany further.”\nMrs. Atherton, who has been a wid\now for some years and now lives\nabroad, has always had a mind of her\nown. She says of her girlhood:\n"When I was a little bit of a girl 1\nused to long for adventure. 1 would\nnjn away from oar little ranch and\npipage Into tbe woods. My mother\nwould send somebody to hunt for me,\nwhich was a wild goose chase. When\nI chose to be found I would lx*. Then\nI was carried back and spanked. Every\nday I got a spanking. Oh.
