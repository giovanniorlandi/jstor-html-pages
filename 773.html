Judges,\nlawyers anil women witnesses would\nappreciate It If they did.\n"When a woman under suspicion\ntakeB the oath it Is desirable to look\nher In the eye," said a lawyer, "but\nhow can anybody look Into the eye of\na woman who has on a stylish hat?\nThe court Is in luck If he can see her\nmouth and the top end of her nose.\nAlso It offends the dignity of the court\nfor a woman to remove her hat; con\nsequently they flounder between the\nhorns of a very serious dilemma. An\norder to tilt her hat back Is also the\nprecursor of difficulties, because the\nhat Is clamped down with so many\npins that It won\'t tilt ? ?\n"Still the eyes of a woman before j\nthe bar of Justice must be looked at.\nand under repeated exhortations she\nreluctantly removes the pins and\nshoves her hat back. But that panto |\nmime results In wnste of time and\nloss of temper all around. In order\nto obviate these evils It seems to me\nthat milliners would bett< ;? busy them\nselves designing a tlpablo bat for\ncourt-room wear.\nOON\'T NEED WALKING STICK\nAmericans Do Not Often Carry It, but\nIs a Matter Purely of Per\nsonal Choice.\nNow that we are reminded of It, we\nrealize that the groat American people\nare seldom seen to possess a walking\nstick. "It\'s a small thins," writes\nan essayist In a morning paper. "the\nabsence of the walking stick, but It\nbelongs to the American motto, never,\nIn the hustle of life, carry unnecessary\ncargo." Th? Idea Is, of course, fantas\ntic with the fantasy of trarispontln<\ncommon sen^e. The hustle of life\nsurely extends to travel In the case\nof ? nation which would consider it\nBelf degrad< <1 if It spent longer than a^\nweek in a complete Journey through?\nEurope; ami when Americans travel\nthey are the last to deny themselves\nthe luxury of an extra bit of luggage\nbecause H h.ippens to be unnecessary.\nIt Is cruri .ion knowledge that they go\non loi- ling the liner trunks until the\ncompany\'s cfllcials say "Stop," If only\nto collect so many more steamship\nand hotel labels to add to their al\nready bloated store of these trophies.\nNo. The walking stick is a manor\npurely of personal choice. Most Amer\nicans chance to feel no need for a\nwalking slick, wherens we do. That\nIs how the thing stands. When It\ncomes to a walking stick tln^fcor\'.d\nmust be considered Individuall^^The\nphysical weakling Is quite likely to\nhave a taste for a gigantic club; the\nenormously powerful man who snaps\nbis Sundnw developer before break\nfast as though It were a piece of cotr\nton may select for a walking stick the\nthinnest shred of malacca that money\ncan buy. ?

"If the pictures were tak\nen when the air was perfectly still,\nthen 1f tho living characters happened\nto hn still also the picture would be\nns dead looking as a 35-cent chromo of\n\'Twilight.* Po a time Is selected for\nphotographing the scenes outside\nwhen the wind Is playing old hob with\nthings generally, trees swaying and\nskirts fluttering and hair flyln* ?\nhaven\'t you ever noticed how much\nmore effective a woman Is when her\nhair la streaming behind her like the\nburgee on a racing yacht?
