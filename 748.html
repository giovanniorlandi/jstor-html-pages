M. Heth, of Oakley Farm, Fairfax, County, made a wild dash up, south Alfred street and down x*.uig, street. The horse had wandered from, the farm, six miles below Alexandria, and became frightened on Alfred, street and commenced to run., Turning into King street, the run, down the street was made in record, time, and pedestrians and vehicles, were missed by narrow margins., At times the horse mounted the sidewalks, forcing the people to run into, houses.

The board can not deprive, him of the power necessary to, carry out the rules and regulations, of the police department, and the assignment, of the police force to duty, is held to belong to the chief of police, exclusively. He is the proper, person to carry into effect the regulations, and orders of the police commission., The commission has no right, -to carry its orders into effect itself., 0, The Common Council of Petersburg, on Tuesday night suspended the rules, and unanimously voted an appropriation, of $500 to A.

But if all Alexandrians, clean up their yards and, pools of stagnant water are allowed I, in the streets the work of placing the, city in a sanitary condition will prove, to be a slow process., Thousands of strangers visit Alexandria, during the summer and early, /fill. Many of such take special pains, to scan everything of an unsanitary, :nd untidy nature, and all should desire, that our city pass inspection, not, only in summer but at all times., Recently the people of Rosemont, cent protests to Council against the, accumulations in a lot covering over, a square opposite Spring Park i. j, iion. Their complaint is just, and;, and steps should be taken towards j, eliminating this eyesore., All citizens can vie in the good, vnrlr nf nlacing the city in a sanitary |, and sightly condition. It ia an an-j, cient injunction, "Let every one keep j, his own door step and gutter clean", f, c\'ome, however, thoughtlessly sup-;, rose that when once refuse is moved j, f- om their premises to the gutters, Hint is an end of their obligations., Lvery occupier of a house lias jurisdiction, as far as the centre of the, reet in front of their premises. In, cases which come before the Police, Court, the result of disorders or annoyances., people often fortify themselves, behind this right. In cases of, ivuisances .before their houses, however,, they renounce jurisdiction. AJ1, thould aid in keeping gutters in a, proper condition.

They say they had no idea, that an Irish republic was to be proclaimed., They further say that the, head centres of the movement told, them an invasion was expected May, 2, and they were told it was necessary, for them to hold positions until the, Germans could land.Robert, Emmett was probably as, much disappointed as his sympathizers., He had every reason to sup., pose that when he precipitated a, movement for liberty in Ireland, thousands would rise up to aid in, throwing off the British yoke. They, failed, however, to materialize, and, * ^ - \' + Vmmoff\'e, at the crisis m me revun,, unu..v.? followers, numbered about twenty., It is the same old story?the participants, in the recent movement did, not know that overt acts were contemplated,, and it affords another, warning against embarking in any, questionable movement until the cost, is counted. Jack Shcppard, desperate, character as he was, had no idea, "Blueskin" intended to stab to death, Mrs. Wood, his former mistress,, when they invaded her house at night., Jack was horrified at the act., A chapter in the Newgate Calendar, tells a sad story. A young man with, a wife and a baby moved into a cer, tain < part of Ireland where he had, rented a smalj, .piece of land. After, he had settled down several of his, neighbors sought his acquaintance, and told him they were members of, !i society which had been organized, for the benefit of the smaller class, of farmers, and requested permission, to meet at his house that night. He, , assented, and after he had listened, to their discussions he became alarmed,, as he realized they were a band, of .desperadoes, who were ready to, use gun, knifa, or torch in order to, wreak vengeance upon those they regarded, as inimical to their interests., After they had adjourned the young, man told them he had not previously, understood the purposes of the or., ganization and he had no intention of, joining it. He further told them he, Could not allow them to meet at his, house again, although he assured the, band he would say nothing concerning, what he had heard. The men went, away with ominous looks upon their, faces, and late the next night the, young man was awakened by finding, his house burning. A crowd surrounded, the building and\'&^ad at the, windows when the farmer appeared,, and he died defending his home. His, wife, frantic with fear, appeared at, a window, but it was impossible for, her to get through the flames. In her, desperation she picked up her baby, and threw it a safe distance beyond, the fire, when a brutal" member of, the mob [licked up the infant anil, threw it into the flames., Had Mrs. Surratt known she was, harboring men bent upon assassination,, John Wilkes Booth and his coadjutors, would not have obtained entertainment, at her home. She may, have believed them to be would-be abductors., This was all the offense ol, this unfortunate woman, and she was, hanged nearly half a century ago, for having allowed the conspirators, p* to enter her house., \' The biblical injunction ?"\'Go nol, in the way of bad men, nor cast youi, lot with them"?is a timely warninj, to all., BLA31ES Till-; ?, NEWSPAPERS., The Richmond Journal suggest, that the newspapers are vesponsibl, for Theodore Roosevelt\'s continuou, appearance before the public.

Roosevelt, should be ignored by the reputable, press so that, like a toy balloon, he, may collapse., This indictment is just. Should the, newspapers ignore the former President, he would soon be forgotten in, this busy age. But, unfortunately,, 41 \' 1 ^ - t- - J, every imng ne utters is rusneu uiw, print, and that is what the colonel, desires., After over half a century\'s observation, in a newspaper office, the writei, could publish enough reminiscences, in connection with the above to fill, every column of the Gazette. While, the small fry of humanity are nevei, better pleased than when they find, their names in print, others of more, notoriety are equally enthused wher., they find themselves subjects of comment, in papers. Some are totally in- >, different as to the manner in which, their names |are printed, all they, want is notoriety., A solemn-looking man (a stranger), once approached a knight of the quill, in this city and said he was convinced, he was a natural grandson o 1, George Washington. The newspapei, ! man called his attention to the fact, I, that should his statement prove true, it would be a reflection upon his, j grandmother. The stranger was not, averse to casting such an insinuation, j upon his progenitress in <u*der to, (get his name into print,, i A would-be politician on one oc|, casion upbraided an attache of this, j paper because, as he alleged his name, j seldom appeared in print in connecJ, tion with the boiling of the political, j pot in his neighborhood. The news;, paper man told him his name would, joe published when it was in order,, j The man finally said: "I do not care, j what you say concerning me. You, |may apply a certain epitnei n you, J choose. "The epithet was one no, j good man deserves and wnn... no, \' brave man would take., Many years ago a tramp preacher,, i self ordained, took up his abode in, i this city. He met the writer on the, ! streets and requested him to call the, . attention of the public to the ?.el, .that he was in town. He said further:, | T haven\'t the slightest objection to, i anything you may say concerning, me. You can use any language you, please, and attack mc as violently a:, > you can."/, It may be unnecessary to state, \' that in many cases articles eommen;, datory of certain individuals are writent, by themselves. This is often done, : by people in honorable positions a>., well as by others who attempt to, ;scale the steep hill of fame., \' In a certain city not long ago a, would-be great man became offended, with the reporters of the papers of, the place. He made bitter attacks, : upon the knights of the quill, sup:, posing they would retort, which he, . wanted them to do. The reporters, xiet later, when a dean of the party, gave the following sensible advice:, :"Let that man severely alone. Nevei, mention his name in future, and, In a short time he will have passed, into a total eclipse." His advice was, heeded, and it was not long before, \' the ambitious individual made overtures, for peace. The reporters, howlover,, adhorcd to their determination,, and the man was finally forgotten in, me community in which he thiro*Tor, prominence., Should Roosevelt be let alone, h<, : would eventually flicker and go out, n ., THIS COUNTRY, iFOK TEACH., j I, ( This country is for peace, but il, i does not fear war.

For almost a century, and\' a half of national existence the, United States has given to the world, the finest example it has ever had, of a self-governed people. Underneath, all the so-called national hysteria, lies a broad and deep base of, devotion to a concept of freedom that, will make the extreme sacrifice for, its preservation., The diplomat or ruler who does not ,, recognize this make a serious blunder., The peple of the United States, are united on a record of peace, but, will maintain its institutions at any, cost., 0, IRISH EXECUTIONS, < Amovi/?nn^, Swift justice has been meted out, to the ringleaders in the so-called, Irish revolution. The execution of, Pearse and his associates in fomenting, the revolt that caused the do*th, >f many innocent persons as well as, lundreds of the misled rebels is or.e, )f the tragic incidents of a war who^e, ramifications have been varied and, oeyond all human calculation in advance., The deluded scholar, bent up>n, the resuscitation of Gaelic as the, language of the island and the restoration, of its institutions and the, revivification of its past glory, foi"owing, the mirage of his unbalanced, nentality that ideals cannot be materialized, by gunpowder without an, tccounting., The story of the Irish rebellion w ll, iong be told as one of the most rcnarkable, and unbalanced outbreaks, .hat have ever occurred in the his;ory, of social revolutions in England, and its dependencies. There wili, stand out no more interesting episode, of this nature for the historian, Df a hundred or two hundred years, hence than the strange Dublin outbreak, with its vast harvest of disaster, and death., -The flattening deduction for Engand, from the revolt is the firm adlerance, of the masses of th elrish, to the empire and inability of any, lisaffected element to break the imoerial, tie.
