President Tafi today opetied\nt\'.ie gales of the $3.uo0.000 Gunnison\nt uinel. turning tlie flow of a river\niiit- t!ie ma:miteent bora and the\nmain and distributing canals. and\nthereby reclaimed to enormous -pro-.lueilvity\nan arid empire of I50.o0\nacres. The opening of this tunnel\nmarked the completion of one of iho\nmost stupendous irrigation projects\never attempted and will transform a\ndesert Into fertile farms which will\nprovide homes and good incomes for\nnot less than ln.oim families.\nThe visit of the President to Mont\nrose and the opening of Uie tunnel\nwas made the occasion of a great ce\nlebration in which practically the en\nlire opula;ion of this section of Col\norado art.!cipated. A .program of\n"Wild West" contestis and amise\nrrents including a race of pretty cow\ngirls (mounted on their own fleet PO\nTiies was carried out for the delega\ntion of the distinguished visitors.\nTo a ranchman in Pelta county,\nColorado, must le given the credit for\nconceiving the idea of building the\nlongest irrigaiion tunnel in the world.\nHe knew that the I\'noomiwuigre val\nley, in the southwestern part of Colo\nrado, and In which Delta county Is lo\ncated, was as fertile as any locality\nIn the west if an adequate water sup\npi v could be secured. Half, a dozen\nmiles away from the valley the Gun\nnison river was flowing to waste be\ntween the walls of a canynu which\noniet icnes ran up as high as 2.5h\nfeet above the river \'bed and it seem\ned impossible that the w-ater could\never be taken wit for Irrigation.\nWhen this ranchman. Meade. Ham\nniotul lmc&me a mecii\'.tr of the Colo\nrado legislature he propounded his\nscheme, which was to build a tunnel\nsix miles long under the mountain\nrnnge which separated the river from\ni he valley, carry the water of the\nriver through the tunnel and thence\nover the valley In Irrigating ditches.\nThe scheme at first looked vt-lon-arv.\nbut $25.ooo spent in preliminarv\nwork convinced the State of Colo.-ali\nthat it was feasible. The I\'nited\n:\'\n:\n;\n:\nv.\n1\nm\nV.\nfi\nI\nH\nv\nP\nV\n9\ng\n\'i\nS\nStates reclamation service was asked\nfur help and it spent four years In In\nvestigating before It undertook the\nwork of ibiilding the tunnel, which\nha.i taken up another four years.\nThe total cost of Uie tunnel will be\nover $3,000,000. ibit the peculiar fea\nture U that I\'ncle Sam only loans this\nmoney to the farmers who axe to toe\n1 cfit -by receiving wuier. Of all tiae\nmillions spent .by Uie government In\nvarious pmMic improvements, this Is\nprolvUily the first niine in history that\nfc.iy of t he ciioney has tieen paid back.\nThe total cost of building the tunnel\nIs to i! divided anions the farmers,\nrecording to the acreage they pos\nsess, j\nIt wa said \'that lO.Oort families\ncould fini homes and pood Incomes\non t!.is land, and the statement was\nIn no wise exaggerated. Delta coun\nty, in which a greater part of the land\nis located, is one of the greatest fruit\nproducing sections in the west and\nthe liege.t in the state of Colorado.\n.ny fiuit jrrower who cuakes less than\nfinrt an acre off his laud thinks he\nhas had a crop failure, and the profits\nhave run up as high as $l.:iu). With\nan average of $2it. or even less off\n1.1 acre tract, it will lie seen that the\nfamer will have a good income. "The\nvr: t fertility of ihe land was one of\nthe points which determined the gov\neminent to build the tunnel.\nThe iieople who have settled In Del\nta county also are jiee\'iliar for a\nfarming community. A large pe.rcen\ntaire of them are former iprofesslonal\nmen wearied or ihroken down -by the\nstrain of life hi the city. These are\nn-en who (become most successful, for\nthey have trained intellects and are\n! to get tiie best results from their\nfarms..\nOne crn srft .some slight idea of the\ns!e of the tunnel from figures. It Is\nsix miles long and a cross section Is\n12x1S feet. Kvery inch of it is cement-lined,\nand it delivers 1.300 cubic\nfeet of water every second. As the\nwater flows out into the ditches It\nwill be used to develop electricity to\nfurnish light and power for Delta\ncounty. And all .built for the Interest\nof $.".000.0ou for ten years, which Is\nthe tine given the farmers to pay\nit-ark t\'leir money.\nIn the four years it took to blast\nout the Gunnison tunnel many thrill\ning experiences came to the men en\ne--red in the work. H was a long and\ntireless task, ihorlng through the eter\nnal fastness of that huge mountain.\nFor the \'most part the rock Is vol\ncanic in character of the Archaic per\nled. tough and obdurate. Yet there\nwere adventures alon-i the route. A\nfew times there were finds in the\'way\nor nusrgets of gold. Several times\nthey encountered streams of hot wa\nter, but snore often streams of cold\nwater, some of them highly mineral\nIn character. Somelimes following\nthe heaw blasts millions of p.il\'ons of\nwater rushed In upon the workmen,\nwho had to t\'va;tle for their lives. Near\nthe valley end of the tunnel an old\nocean bed was found, and in the rock\ncountless numbers of sea shells of\ndifferent sizes. Through this rock\nthe work was very dangerous and re\nquired constant timpering. In the\nspring of 1 95 the drills ran into an\nI\'nderground stream which caused a\ncave-in. and for forty-eight hours a\nnumber of workmen were \'burled\nalive. iA fbaft was sunk from the out\nside and the men were saved. The\nr timber of men that were caught In\nthe care-In were -pltmd down (by\nrocV-s. but those who were free to\nwork had shoveled wp dikes to keep\nthe water away from their Injured\ncomrades, and thus saving their lives.\nThe human race has never yet ac\ncomplished such a marvel as this\ntunnel. It is the longest underground\nwaterway ever constructed, and H Is\nthe cause for congratulation that it\nhas been built without the loss of a\nhuman life.\nSECRETARY KNOX WILL NOT\nGO TO MEET PRESIDENT DIAZ\nWashington.

Declaring\nthat the inequalities of the preeen".\nmethod of assessing and collecting\nthe property tax are numerous and\ngrave, L. G. Powers, cat el statistician\nof the Census Bureau, urged the\nadoption of a uniform listing of real\nestate .which will show more clearly\nitlia value land uesatnent tot tp,\nestate. He advocated -what be term\ned the analytical and statistical meth\nods in the listing of real estate tor\ntaxation and claimed that the applica\ntion of this method would take the\nquestion of property taxation out of\nthe reach of demagogues and cheap\npoliticians and that it would serve to\nsnojw tne proportion or me general\ntax that la \'being paid iby the farmer.\nthe henberman, and the railroads.\nMany economic -writers and stu\ndents of public finance have in thd\npast fifty years called attention to\nthe imperfections of existing systems\nof obtaining public revenue." said Mr.\nPowers, "and the desirability of find\ning, if possible, some substitute for\nriie gftera.l pitbperty tax". \' While\nmany miner changes have been made\nIn the methods of obtaining state and\nlocal revenue, said Mr. Powers, today\nas at the middle of -the last century.\nlocal governments and most state\ngovernments ia the United States and\nCanada rely principally upon the\ngeneral property tax for their reve\nnue, and will in all probability con\ntiinue to do so for the next fifty years.\nTnd.r itoii circumstances the\npractical man, striving to improve the\na" km in 1st rat ion of public (business." he\ncor-tinued. "will give his attention prt-\nmarilv to a consideration of methods\nof freeing ihe assessment and collec\ntion of that tax from the inequalities\nwhich now accompany them. Those\ninequalities are numerous and grave.\nMany townships can be found in the\ncountry in which a farm with a sell\nin-g value or $.",.\'( mi is subject to ihe\nsame tax as a second farm in ano\'.ier\npart of the township with a selling\nvalue of flo.Oim: and the townships\'\nare legion In numiber in which farm\nproper v used for residential, manu\nfacturing and other purpose.\nMr. Powers insisted that the Tleed\nfor improving the methods of assess\ning real property was evidenced by\nthe fact that for forty yers at least\nper cent of I he . general property\ntax of the United States has been\nlrvied ami collected iiKn realty. He\nsaid that although -the proper listing\nand reporting of realty for purposes\nc-f taxation should be given greater\nconsideration than Is given to the cor\nresponding Hitting of \'personality\nthat suoli is nowhere ihe case.\n\'Some of -the most Intelligent peo\npie claim that the railroads are pay\ning relatively only one-third as much\ntax as the farmers and lumbermen\na id on the other hand, -the railroads\nciaim that they are paying as heav\na tax as the farmer, and their burden\nof taxation is much greater relativel\nthan that of the lirmibernian, conitin\nucd Mr. Powers. "An analysis of the\npublished reports of the state and\ncomparisons of the data of such re\nipori with reliable information oh)\nttainable ifrom omher sources ,lik\nfail to be conclusive as to the con\ntent ion of any of the parties to this\ncontroversy.\n"So long as this condition pre\nvails, the state referred to will afford\nthe dishonest firm or corporation\nready means for evading just taxation\nand will find the subject of taxation\nand the administration of public er\nvice corporations are used by dema\ngogues for t\'he purpose of stirring n\nstrife and agitation, without advocat\nlug the interests of any class of the\npople. or ny industry In the comma\nnl\'.y. -All industries will continue\nlie more or less disturbed and sub\njects! to unjust \'burdens, suspicion\nand annoyance.\nMr. Powers outlined his idea of the\nmethod which should govern the lisi\nliig of real property. The stat\nshould prepare a careful cadaster\nol\nall real estate, he said, this cadaster\nto show the acreage under cultivation\nthat covered \'With timber, with or\nchards and waste land, and land which\ntrav be plowed. The classified lis\nof acres should also show the number\nof acres of mineral land, of quarry\nland, and land valuable ror oil. gas or\noiher deposits. The cadaster should\nalso show .e number of city and\ntown lots subject to taxation. M\nPowers added that the cadaster should\nhe supplemented by a listing of the\nvalue of the property apart -from the\nvalue of the land.\n"When we have a classified Hstin\nof acre property that segregates areas\nand values aocortling to the character\nrf the land, and separately sets forth\nte values of the improvements on\nevery class of land, we will have th\napplication of the analytical and sta\ntistical method to the taxation of rea\nKy." continued Mr. Powers. "We sha\nhave as Intelligent and lucid a state\nment of acre property subject to ta\nat ion as some of our states now pro\nvide their citizens with reference 1\nnersonal property subject to the ta\nWhen such a listing is made, the far\nTrers and other classes of citizens\nwill have the data for determining ap;\nproximately whether they are be in\ntaxed more than other classes an\nthe people engaged in productive in\ndustries will know whether thev are\nhea-inr burdens which should \'be shaiu\ned 4ut are not borne to an equal de\ngree ."by the speculator.\nI sen merely ureirrg the application\nto taxation of analytical and statist\'\ncal -methods which the business -world\nhas utilized in so many fields, an\nupon -which It Is relying in an over-\nincreasing measure as a guide for\nbusiness administrations.\' \'said Mr.\nPowers in concluding. "Correct an\nalysis lies at the basis of ail modern\nbusiness success : and statistics (based\nupon such analysis are playing an ov\ner Increasing part In guaranteeing\nsuch success. In pleading for the use\nof a classified listing of real estate\nunder heads that fully elucidate and\nset forth the character of land an\nthe amount of land of each specific\nclass or character.
