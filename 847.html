These\nreviews of the experts\' reports.\nwritten by Milo R. Maltbie, Wal\nton Clark, vice president of the\nUnited Gas Improvement company\nof Philadelphia, and Charles L.\nEdgar, president of the Edison\nElectric and Illuminating company\nof Boston, are divided in opinion\nas to the success of the undertak\nings as a whole.\nMr. Maltbie is one of the mem\nbers of the newly created Public\nService Commission for Greater\nNew York. This body has the\nwidest powers and the greatest res\nponsibilities of any commission to\nwhich" the regulation of corpora\ntions has been entrusted, up to\nthis time, in the United States.\nMr. Maltbie spent six months in\nGreat Britain, superyisingthe work\nof the expert accountants and en\ngineers. He says that municipal\noperation of public utilities in\nGreat Britain has passed the ex\nperimental stage. He declares that\nthe gas and electric plants operat\ned by municipalities, generally\ngive a superior service at rela\ntively lower cost, as compared with\nthe privately owned companies.\nThis condition he finds to be due\nprincipally to the higher rate of\ninterest and profit and the greater\namount of liabilities of the private\ncompanies.\nThe reasons that v have led to\nBritish municipalization, Mr.\nMaltbie finds, are many. First\namong tnem, aitnougn not tne\nmost general nor the most impor\ntant, is the desire to secure for the\npublic the financial profits of the\nundertaking. Second, there is the\ndesire to keep the city from being\nmulcted by a private company,\nand third, the general demand for\nbetter service at lower rates. He\nmentions also, a fourth cause,\nwhich has played a prsminent part\nin the United States, and which v\nnot unknown in Great Britain,-\nnamely, opposition of privately\noperated public utilities companies\nto the welfare of the city. A fifth\nfactor has been "the belief that\nmunicipal operation would permit\nthe co-ordination of public services\nin a way that.is not possible where\ndifferent services are operated by\nprivate companies.\nMessrs. Edgar and Clark, repre\nsenting the corporations wmcu\nhave crown fat on franchises se\ncured from easy going municipal!\nties admit that some form of regula\ntion of private, companies should\nbe inaugurated if the adoption of\nthe municipal ownership idea is\nDrevented. They hold that the\nsolution of present difficulties is to\nbe found, not in municipal owner\nship and operation of the public\nutilities, but in the election of.\nmunicipal officers who will protect\nthe governed against injustice on\nthe part of individuals or corpora\'\ntions.\nTo Whom It May Concern.\nParties are selling and trying to\nsell land assuring purchasers that\nthe land will be watered by the\nHarlingen Canal Co.\nUnder the circumstances, we\ndeem it iustice to all to state that\nwe will positively water only land\nowned by us, and no other lands.\nHarlingen Land and Canal Co.\nJ-14-tf. Lon C. Hrxx\nDEATH OF MRS. M V. GARY\nFormerly Lived at Brownsville, Being\nProminently Connected.\nThe Houston papers report the\ndeath in that city of Mrs. Mar\ngaret Vernon Gary, which oc\ncurred on the 16th instaut.\nThe deceased lady was formerly\nwell know in Brownsville. She\nresided in Matamoros with her\nfamily during the Mexican war,\nin 1846, moving later to Browns\nville. Her stepfather, Mr. Edward\nWinfield, was the first represen\ntative in the legislature from Cam\neron county, after its organization.\nShe was married at Brownsville in\n1850 to Maj. John E, Gary.\nThe funeral of Mrs. Gary took\nplace at Houston the 17th instant.\nThe members of San Jacinto Chap\nter, U. D. C, and of the Houston\nAltar and Rosary Societies attended\nin a body,,the deceased having\nbeen a member of these\ntion.\norganiza-\nSaturdays.\nThere is a Spanish saying, If\nyou are in search of a wife, hunt\nher on Saturday." Then is when\nthe true nature of the girl is made\nmanifest. Saturday is full of\nhousehold duties cleaning, cook\ning, getting tnings ready and turn\ning lifelongings into matter-of-fact.\nThe true inwardness of a person\ndoesa\'t always show up in fashion\nable clothes and company inter\ncourse. One needs to learn if\nanother can turn the discordant\nnotes of Saturday\'s duties into a\nmelody; to see what beauty she\nshows in a plain grace and a large\napron; to Know it tnere is grace in\nher .motions, whea she fondles the\npie crust or brushes out the parlor;\n-\nto discover if she still has her\nradiant smile when she helps\nmother peel the potatoes.\nShe doesn\'t do these things, eh?\nThen you cannot find out, and\nyou run a risk. If you call Sun\nday night or when you are ex\npected, you are kept in the dark.\nThe glamor of appearance obstructs\nyour vision. This is what the\nSpanish proverb means. We only\nattempt, interpretation. All pro\nverbs have a deal of sense back of\nthem. This one teaches that Sat\nurday, especially in the morning,\nwhen duty crowds, reveals more\nof a girl\'s tendency and outcome\nthen any other time in the week\nIf she is lolling, and frowsy, and\ntired, and good-for nothing, look\niog over lace and putting away\njewelry, and turning no helping\nhand to the jocund duties of the\nday if that is the kind of dear,\nsweet girl the, searcher is searching\nfor. he will very likely find her on\nSaturday. So the proverb says\nWe dont\'t know. We can hardly\nbelieve it. But we must be faithfnl\nte the oroverb.

The\n-Herald does not hesitate\nto say that it does not believe that\nmen of such business integrity as\nthose who stand at the head of our\ntanks could be influenced by such\na mean consideration.

We will\n&ardly sell ourselves body and\n-soul for half a century to a\n-Shreveport \'street\' railroad syn\ndicate because that concern has\nseen fit to deposit this diminutive\nsunt in our town.\nStatistics, show that the cost of\n-water and fights to consumers\nis usually three times as much un\nder private ownership as under city\nownership.\nCosie, now, just think the wa\nterworks and light question over\nonce more, and join forces with the\n-side of city ownership and progress.\n"The bond.issue means the imme\ndiate construction of a water and\nlight plant. \' The franchise means\nTaiore delay, uncertainty, greater\nexpense in the end and the build\ning up of private fortunes at the\nexpense of the taxpayers.
