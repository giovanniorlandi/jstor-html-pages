Cochran, $3gga& Tel. Monroe 353.\nEditor and Publisher. sgjg$ Automatic 51-422.\n500 South Peoria St. 398 By Mail, 50 Cents a Month,\nVOL.3, NO. 144 Chicago, Wednesday, March 18, 1914 ONE CENT\nYOUNG LAWYERS PROTEST AGAINST\nJUDGE IN CIRCUIT COURT\nCalling In -of Judge Harry Waggoner To Pass OnChi\ncago Cases Brings Forth Kicks Attorneys Go\nTo Judge Petit But Waggoner Gets\nthe Appointment.\nThe bringing in of Jiidge Harry\nWaggoner from Macomb to again sit\non a court bench and pass on Chi\ncago cases has started talk among\nmembers-of the Chicago Bar Associa\ntion about Jud.ge Waggoner's pecu\nliar connections and record as a cor\nporation lawyer.\nIt is known that several younger\nattorneys who are not tied up in any\nway with railroads or big industrial\ncompanies went to Adelor Petit, the\nchief, 'justice who picks- the down\nBtate judge who shall come here ahd\nhelp out when fhe-. calendar is\ncrowded.\nThese younger men called Judge\nPetit's attention to Waggoner's rec\nord and asked Petit that some other\njurist than Waggoner be picked for\nextra duty in Chicago.,\nThey alleged that Harry M. Wag\ngoner is the friendliest railway judge\nin all the circuit courts of the state of\nIllinois.\nThey intimated that Waggoner\nwas suggested to Petit by railroad\nattorneys who want him here in, Chi\ncago for a time in order to. clean of", 'from the calendar some cases that\nthe railroads would not feel safe\nabout with some of the judges who\nmust be elected in Chicago.\nPetit said he would consider the\nmatter. In the eud, Waggoner was\nnamed to come here and he opened\ncourt Monday. The cases before\nhim yesterday and Monday are chief\nly cases where the Illinois Gentral\nRailway and the Chicago City Rail\nways Co. are mixed up.\nThe firm of lawyers who have more\ncases than any other firm before\nWaggoner are Winston, Payne,\nStrawn and Shaw. This firm is rep\nresenting the Ghicago Junction Rail\nway Co. and the Michigan Central\nRailway in cases on this week.\nIndividual: members of the same\nfirm are representing other railroad\ncompanies before Waggoner. John\nBarton Payne is pleading for the Chi\ncago & Great Western Railway Co.\nPayne also appears in the case of\nMiller vs. the Illinois Central. (On\nthe side, this is 1 the same John\nBarton Payne who is president of the\nSouth Park Board. He has won ad\nmiration for the way he has of goingd\ninto court during tne day time and\narguing cases for the Illinois Central\nas the company\'s lawyer and then at\nnight going to a meeting of the South\nPark Board and giving the board ad\nvice on what to do about land deals\nwith the Illinois .Central. It takes a\n. lot of face to get away with this, but\nJohn Barton Payne pulls it regu\nlarly.) The bar association members who\nfeel that an injustice has been done\nthe lawyers of the city who have\ncases against railroads before Wag\ngoner assert, that Silas H. Strawn,\npresident of the Chicago Bar Asso\nciation, used his "good efforts" to get\nJudge Waggoner brought on to Chi\ncago. Besides the railroads previous\nly mentioned, which are advised by\nStrawn\'s firm, Strawn is scheduled\nto argue this week for the Chicago &\n.Alton Railway Co. before Judge Waggoner.\nSome of the high lights\' in Judge\nWaggoner\'s record called to tne at\ntention of Judge Petit by the young\ner members of the bar are:\nWaggoner was attorney for the\nChicago, Burlington & Quincy Rail\nroad nearly ten years.\nWaggoner reorganized the legal\nform of the Burlington road so that\nthe farmer whose cow was killed, or\nthe brakeman who had an arm cut\noff, would\' have to go into the federal\ncourt in Peoria, and sometimes carry\nthe case clean up to. the United States\nSupreme Court before the case was\nfinally determined.\nWaggoner ran for circuit judge in\n1909 and where the two other judges,\nelected with him George W. Thomp\nson and Robert J. Grier, had majori\nties that ran over 4,000, Waggoner\'s\nmajority was only 45. His opponent,\nJ.H.Williams of Carthage, questioned\nthe validity of this slim majority and\nstated\' publicly that the only reason\nhe did not contest the election was\nthat he could not bring as many bar\nrels of money into the fight as Wag\ngoner could. \'\nWaggoner lived in Lewiston at the\ntime of election and lost his home\nprecinct, township and county. The\ncounty is normally Republican by\n600 to 1,000 majority and Waggoner\nwas running on a Republican ticket.\nWaggoner\'s administration of law\nin the Superior courts when he was.\nin Chicago before on a previous occa\nsion was "unfair" and his manner so\n"irascible" that it is predicted he will,\nnever again sit on a Superior court\nbench.\nWaggoner contemptuously used\nthe epithet "Sheeny" in referring to\none of his colleagues on the, Superior\nbench.\nPressure fronfrailroad\' sources was\nexerted to get Judge Waggoner on\nthe Superior bdnch during the pres\nent, term of court, but his previous\nconduct toward his colleagues, and\nparticularly his coarse language di\nrected at a Jewish colleague, barred\nhim put.', 'SAYS GOOD MANY CHURCHES\nSHOULDBE WIPED OUT\nDenver, Col., March 18. "Amer\nica is over-churched. If some provi\ndential hand could sweep over the\ncountry and carry off about one\ntenth of the churches that exist, it\nwould be a merciful dispensation.\nThe number of churches is too far in\nexcess of the number of men who are\nwilling to go into the ministry."\nDr.. Robert P. Coyle, who, on June\n1, resigns his pastorate of the Cen\ntral Presbyterian Church to go to the\nPacific coast, today outlined his im\npressions of his 14 years\' ministry\nhere.\n"The day is coming when the\nProtestant churches -will -be one," he\nadded. "Sectarian prejudices no\nlonger hold ground with the educated\nand creeds are slowly dying.\n"In the coming milleninm, where\nchurch unity has been established,\nthere will be but one church to a dis\ntrict say of 2,500 or 3,500 persons.\nThe poverty of churches today is\ncaused by the fact that there are .too\nmany of them. You go into a small\nplace of 3,000 .and find five or six\nstruggling churches where one could\nenjoy prosperity and amply satisfy\nthe religious and social needs of the\ncommunity."\nWANT YOUNGEST "LIFER" IN\nTHE PEN TURNED FREE\nHerman Coppess, the youngest life\nprisoner ever behind the walls of the\nJoliet penitentiary, rammed his hands\ndeep into his pockets and emitted a\nloud whistle today when told that\nGov. Dunne, had been appealed to to\nhave him paroled or pardoned.\n"Gee that\'d be fine," grinned the\nfourteen-year-old youngster. "I\'m\nfifteen next Wednesday and that\'d\nget me out in time for my birthday."\nHerman was forced to shed short\ntrousers and don regular convicts\ngarb when he went behind the walls,\nconvicted of killing Mrs. Manny\nbieep, a farmer\'s wife, and her two\nchildren, near Elgin, April, 1913. He\nhas been employed as a runner for\nPrison Chaplain Patrick.\nJack Robbins, associated with Up\nton Sinclair in the "Last Chance\nBoys\' Club," visited Herman here and\nlast night wired Gov. Dunne asking\nthat the boy be freed. Robbins said\nhe found a farmer near Big Rock, 111.,\nwho said he would care for the boy.\nGov. Dunne is in Scranton, Pa., to\nday, but will be" asked to act when he\nreturns to Springfield.\nBOLD BANDIT STICKS UP BRIGGS\nHOUSE ONE SHOT\nA lone bandit entered the Briggs\nHouse shortly after 2 o\'clock this\nmorning, robbed the cash box of\n$150, tried to rob the safe and, after\nbeing foiled, shot down William\nStrumer, the assistant manager, and\nfled.\nStrumer was talking to Philip D.\nGreenwood, the night clerk, when\nthe bandit entered. The intruder or\ndered them to throw up their hands.\nThen he grabbed the cash box. Wal\nton McClure, a bellboy, saved the\nsafe by delaying the bandit\'s game\nwith conversation.\nThe bandit took fright at the en\ntrance of two people and ran out\nfiring shots at Sturmer. Outside the\nbandit leaped into an auto and es\ncaped. Strumer will recover.\no o\nSUFFRAGETS GET IN WRONG\nLondon, March 18. Suffragets\nwho tried to address King George\nand Queen Mary while they were at\ntending a matinee at the Palladium\nwere ejected after they had showered\nthe royal box with "votes for wo\nmen" literature. The audience hiss\ned them and vigorously applauded\nthe king and queen.\nLilian Russell is honeymooning in\nthe West Indies. Lily shouldn\'t use\nall of the Indies, this time. There\nmay be many more happy weddings\nin store for Lily, and there are not\ntoo .many new places left for Lily to\nmoon in,', 'POLICE ADMIT HABIT OF ACCEPTING FAVORS\nFROM STRIKEBOUND ESTABLISHMENTS\nThat police on strike duty are in\nthe habits of accepting favors from\nthe owners of the strike-bound estab\nlishment was the admission 6f Police\nSergeant John Anderson before the\nthree judges hearing the Henrici res\ntaurant injunction proceedings.\n"We ate at Henrici\'s during the\ntrouble," admitted Anderson. "The\npolice are always take care of at the\nexpense of the employers during a\nstrike. It\'s the usual custom."\'\nAnderson cited the newspaper\nstrike, the freight handlers\' strike and\nthe strike of the teamsters as strikes\nwherein the police were taken care\nof."\nWm. G. Collins was recalled to the\nstand by Attorney Edgar Lee Masters,\ncounsel for the waitresses, and quiz\nzed concerning the union of restau\nrant bosses.\nHe admitted that representatives\nfrom the States restaurant, Plant\ners\', Al Tearney\'s, The Rienzi, Tom\nChamales\', Old Savoy, Kuntz-Remm-ler\'s\nand the Auto Inn were there in\naddition to the list already given out.\nPolicewoman Anna Loucks testi\nfied that she was given the 53 affi\ndavits from the\' Henrici\'s employes,\nin which they said they were satis\nfied, by Major Funkhouser and told to\ninterview the girls.\nShe went to Collins and when she\nsaid she was a policewoman he al\nlowed her to interview the girls, al\nthough he had refused permission to\nthe committee of clubwomen.\nMike Hurley (Officer 813) swore\nthat he was gentle in handling the\ngirls.\nAnna Burke, owner ot the hotel\nwhere Ora Duree roomed at the time\nher arm was twisted by the police,\nsaid that she had seen Miss Duree\ncombing her hair and using the in\njured hand right after the occur\nrence. She denied the charge that she\naided private detectives, hired by\nHenrici\'s, in spying on Miss Duree by\ntaking down the shade in the girl\'s\nroom.\nAssistant Corporation Counsel\nGaney argued for the police and said\nthere was "tranquility on Randolph\nstreet before the witresses\' strike."\nAttorney Willard McEwen opened\nthe arguments for the restaurant\nbosses and said that if the waitresses\nwere successful at Henrici\'s they\nwould next attack The Fair depart\nment store.\n"No other case that you judges\nhave on your calendars is as import\nant in principle as this case and if\nthe waitresses win it will be virtually\nthe granting of the right to attack\nany house in the loop."\n.

Search for\nsix persons missing and\' supposed to\nbe under the wreckage of the St.\nLouis Seed Company building was re\nsumed today.

In\nthe seed store salesgirls, stenograph\ners, bookkeepers and laborers were\ncought under the ruins, and ambu\nlances immediately summoned took\nfour injured out in a few minutes, but\nthe work of rescuing others caught\nunder heavy elevator machinery was\nslow and it is not believed that every\none is yet accounted for.\no o\nPARIS HAS STARTLING CASE OF\n"UNWRITTEN LAW" ON HAND\nParis, March 18. Out of the mix\nture of women and politics, tragedy\nand cabinet disruption, came the al\nmost positive assurance today that\nFrance will undergo an ordeal second\nonly to the Dreyfus trial, when Mme.\nCaillaux, wife of the former minister\nof finance, is placed on trial for the\nmurder of Gaston Calmette, editor of\nthe Figaro.\nIt is a certainty that the defense\nwill be the "unwritten law." Maitre\nLabori, one of the most noted attor\nneys in France, has agreed to defend\nMme. Caillaux, "for the sake of hu\nmanity." He was a friend of Cal\nmette, but he said\' the fact that the\naccused was a woman and without\nfriends led him to accept their case.\nThough efforts will be directed to\nward showing justification for the\nslaying of Calmette by Mme. Caillaux\nin defense of her own name and to\nshield her daughters, the airing of\npolitical intrigues and the shaking of\nthe entire administration is promised\nby the fight that will have to be made\nto save Mme. Caillaux.\nEDDIE FOY WILL FIGHT DEMAND\nOF OSCAR NELSON\nState Inspector Oscar F. Nelson is\ngoing to ask that Eddie Foy voluntar\nily stop the appearance on the stage\nof the seven little Foys. Unless Foy\ndoes this, Nelson says, he will be\nprosecuted on a serious charge.\nFoy and his counsel are highly\npeeved over Nelson\'s ultimatum and\nannounce a fight.', 'ORGANIZED LABOR COMES TO\nAID OF TEACHERS\nOrganized labor yesterday came to\nthe aid of the Chicago school teachers\nwhen a committee from the Chicago\nFederation of Labor -appeared before\nthe finance committee of the school\nboard and pleaded for a 20 per cent\nraise in salaries for the teachers.\nIt was the first time in Chicago\'s\nhistory that union labor had taken\nup the fight of the teachers. And the\nmembers of the school board seemed\nquite shocked. When the report of\nthe coming of the labor representa\ntives reached the board rooms all but\nfour of the 10 members of the finance\ncommittee fled.\nC. D. Wheeler, E. C. Dillon and\nAbraham Peterson, the grievance\ncommittee of the labor body, made\nthe demand for a raise. Mrs. John\nMacMahon, Mrs. Gertrude Howe\nBritton, Charles S. Peterson and. Wil\nliam Rothmann of the finance com\nmittee listened to them.\nThe union men said they repre\nsented 441 teachers out of 77Q and\nthat the teachers they represented\nwant 20 per cent increase instead of\nthe 10 per cent which the school\nboard granted when increasing the\nschool hours.\nThe Chicago Federation of Labor\nrecently protested against the 10 per\ncent and went on record as favoring\n20 per cent.\n"We do not wish the members of\nthe board to submit this question of\nincreased pay for teachers for in\ncreased work of one hour per day to\nany outside organization," said E. C.\nDillon. "We do not approve of the\nefficiency division of the city civil\nservice. We have investigated it and\nfound no use for it."\n"Organized labor stands to de\ncrease working hours," said Abraham\nPeterson. "The teachers are bring\ning this protest as working people.\'\nThey work with their brain as hard\nas others do with their muscles.\nThere is nothing to prevent the en\ngineers getting 20 per cent increase\nfor their extra hour of work, and in\nevent you must work the teachers\nanother hour, then pay the union rate\nof one and one-half or double for\novertime."\nThe finance committee, or what\nwas left of them, promised to con\nsider the demands. School teachers,\nwould not discuss the possibility of a\nstrike.\no o\nFRIEND OF EXPLORER WILL NOT\nATTEMPT SOUTH POLE AGAIN\nCommander E. R. G. R. Evans, the\nlast man to see Explorer J3cott alive,\nsays he wiU never return to the\nfrozen South pole regions. The tor\ntuous experiences of his trip and the\nsad fate of his chief have made an\nindelible impression on his mind.\no o\nDEAF TO DUTY\nThe average man who can hear\nPleasure whisper a- mile away can\'t\nhear Duty when it shouts in his ear\nwith, a megaphone.', "ONE MAN'S OPINIONS\nBY N. D. COCHRAN.\nLabor and Liquor. Behold what a\ngreat blaze the small spark kindleth.\nThe strike at the Henrici restau\nrant appears to be a small thing, but\nit is pregnant with tremendous conse\nquences. If the result of that strike affected\nnobody but the employer and em\nployes directly involved' it wouldn't\namount to much. But already it has\ninvolved practically the entire em\nploying class on one side and all labor\non the other.\nThe Hotel and Restaurant Keeper's\nunion first got back of Henricis, then\nthe State Street Store Owners' union\ngot back of that, and gradually the\n.brewery trust, the organized liquor\ninterests and other capitalistic unions\nare, being involved.\nOn the other hand, back of the\ncooks and waitresses, is the Woman\nTrades Union League, the Chicago\nFederation of Labor and whatever\nfriends union labor can muster.\nThere is some significance also in\nthe fact that many women of influ\nence have interested themselves in\nthe fight of the waitresses for living\nwages, one day's rest in seven and\nmore humane working conditions.\nI am glad of this because it indi\ncates that women are disposed to\ntake their, position politically on the\nhuman instead of the dollar side of\nthe industrial war, which must be\ncome eventually a political war.\nIt is possible that it may bring wo\nmen voters and the workers closer\ntogether politically.\nIt may eventually throw labor on\nthe side of the drys and against the\nwets in Illinois and then the nation.\nI have 'talked with workingmen\nlately, men who have been active on\nthe side of personal liberty which\nhas come to mean liberty only in .the\ninterest of the liquor business, and\nnot liberty in a wider sense for the\nworking class. Liberty to drink all\nthe booze men want to drink, but not\nliberty to organize for bread and but\nter. Some of these men have gone to\nSpringfield to help the liquor interests\nto save their business from attacks\nby the drys.\nThey say now, however, that the\nliquor interests have not only been\nhostile to woman's suffrage, but have\nhelped the employers kill legislation\nin the interest of labor.\nSome of these workers, have said\nto me recently that if the liquor in\nterests are going to fight their efforts\nto get one day's rest in seven through\nlabor organization, then they will be\ndriven to get that one day's rest\nthrough state-wide prohibition.\nThe saloon has always been an ac\ntive influence in politics. One reason\nis that it has been the poor man's\nclub, the only social center open to\nthe workingman. But most of the sa\nloons are now owned or controlled by\nthe brewers, and saloonkeepers, like\nthe small retail business men, have\nbecome little more than clerks for\nrich brewers.\nThe brewers line up with the capi\ntalistic class in the war of labor. It\nmust follow that labor eventually will\nbe at war with the liquor interests,\nand that may force labor to prohibi\ntion as a measure of self-defense.\nI am reporting here what I know\nis running through the minds of\nworkers who see the situation\nmore clearly than do their richer and\nmore ignorant brothers who happen\nto be in the employing class.\nLabor is learning that the rich man\nwho has no heart has a pocketbook,\nand that the pocketbook nerve is the\nmost sensitive nerve the average cap\nitalist has. And they are learning to\nstrike at the pocketbook, when the\nheart and mind are closed to their\nappeals for justice.\nThere are more employes in this\nworld than employers. When em\nployes learn to vote together there\ncan be no argument as to what class\nwill control government It is inevit\n, able that in due course of time the", 'workers will be together in a party\n01 tneir own.\nPenny \'Phone Service. The people\nof Chicago may not appreciate it\nnow, but I am sure th time will come\nwnen tney will understand that Aid\nMerriam rendered a splendid public\nservice, m intelligently fighting the\nattempt to have council give the\ncity\'s consent to the absorption of the\nAutomatic \'phone\' plant by the Bell\n\'phone trust.\nI know of no city that has a better\ncnance to get penny service with a\n\'phone in every home, through muni\ncipal ownership, than Chicago has\nnow.\nI believe if council will investigate\nit will find that the Illinois Tunnel Co.\nhas forfeited its telephone franchise,\n11 not its tunnel franchise, by failing\nto comply with the conditions of that\nirancnise.\nI believe also that the AutnmaHr.\n\'phone, properly managed, is a better\nservice than the old-fashioned Bell\n\'phone; and that this city could easily\nana economically establish municipal\n\'phone service.\n"With \'phone service so cheap that\nthere could be a \'phone in every\nhome, Chicago people would benefit\nmore than by any system of subways\'\nthat can be devised and paid for.\nAnd I believe penny service is easily\npossible under municipal ownership.\nAid.

He had\npointed out to me in each ward the\ndifferent conditions of the patients,\nand now we stood in the corridor be\nfore a table where, under a glass,\nwere typewritten directions for treat\nment of the various stages of alcohol\nism. "You can see by these directions\nthat we have no \'secret\' treatment,"\nDr. Sceleth said, in answer to my\nquery why the Tribune, which had\nlauded the Sceleth Hospital and its\nwork a few months ago, was now in\nsinuating that its treatment was re\nsponsible for the death of three pa\ntients. "We are the only hospital treating\nalcoholic patients," the doctor con\ntinued, "and very few of these pa\ntients come here who have not some\ncomplication in connection with al\ncoholism. One. of the men ,who died\nhad pneumonia.\n"Our mortality rate has been lower\nthan the mortality rate of other phy\nsicians treating these cases. We have\nfelt very proud of our work. We do\nnot pretend to. cure alcoholism. There\nis no drug or combination of drugs\nthat will cure alcoholism, nor that\nwill prevent a man from drinking\nagain when he goes out "\n"Our cure consists of treatment for\nthe alcohol habit. We cure him of\nactive alcoholism. We illustrate to\nthe man that he can get along with\nout alcohol while he is here and he\ndoes not need it when he is out of\nhere.\n"In the case of delirium tremens a\nman does not get delirium tremens\nuntil he has been drinking for ten\nyears. That means that his nervous\nsystem is absolutely changed. The\ncells in his brain are changed. The\nvery convolusions of the brain di\nminish in size through the poisoning\neffect of alcohol.\n"It would be the heighth of ignor\nance or folly for anyone to pretend to\nabsolutely cure by certain remedies\nthe effect of a poison taken from\nup to ten and longer years. What\nwe do is to send him out with a new\nbrain and a new spinal cord.\n\'\'What we have been doing meets\nwith the ethical support of all phy\nsicians. Our treatment is almost par\nallel with that in Bellevue in New\nYork city.\n"And as I said before, many of the\nmen brought here have complica\ntions. Some who are brought as al\ncoholic are not alcoholics. A man\nmay have a fractured skull. His coma\nmay be kidney coma and he may not\nbe drinking. He might be in a col\nlapse from heart disease or from a\nruptured blood .vessel in his brain\nand all these simulate alcoholism.\n"These men are picked up on the\nstreet by policemen. Since this hos\npital has been licensed, and it was\nestablished because the County Hos\npital refused to take these people, the\nofficers bring them here. We diag\nnose their cases and treat them for\nwhatever disease or complication of\ndiseases they may suffer. That is all."\nI left Dr. Sceleth and interviewed\nJbhn M. Whitman, superintendent of\nthe House of Correction.\nI asked Mr. Whitman to tell me if\nhe thought it was an improvement to\nhave the hospital in connection with\nthe House of Correction so long as\nmen suffering from alcoholism were\narrested and sent to the Bridewell\nanyway.\nMr. Whitman\'s response came very\nquickly.\n"About ten years ago the County\nHdspital refused to take in alcohol\nics. The men were arrested, often\nsuffering with a complication of dis\neases, and they were thrown in cells\nwhile they were awaiting\' trial, and\noften died there.', '"When we obtained a license for\nthe hospital here, we did so in prder\nthat men picked up on the street in\nthis condition could be brought here\ndirect for treatmento\'ithout waiting\ncommitment or without being com\nmitted. "They are generally men -who have\n.no friends or relatives that are in a\nposition to see that they get the\nproper care, and for that reason they\nget into the hands of the police, and\nwe feel that the police should be\ngiven an opportunity to place them\nwhere they can get treatment, so we\nhave provided that place. 1\n"Because of the long experience\nthat our medical superintendent, es\npecially, has had in treating alcoholic\ndiseases and diseases generally com\nplicated with it, we have had great\nsuccess.\n"I should like to give you some fig\nures showing results. They prove\nthat the percentage of mortality is\nvery low taking into .consideration\nthe desperate cases handled.\n"We treat about 500 cases a month.\nOut of that 500 cases our death rate\nin December, the heaviest, was 30.\nIn January 11. in February 12. Up.\nto March 15, 11. The statistics show\ning mortality on alcoholic cases, sta\ntistics given by other physicians in\nother hospitals, and recognized as\nauthoritative, .show a death rate of\nfrom 7 to 10, per cent on alcoholic\ncases with no complications.\n"Pneumonia follows in twelve per\ncent of the pases, and the mortality\nrate is between 40 and 60 per cent.\nWith alcoholic cases where there is\nwhat is known as \'wet brain,\' the\nmortality is 75 per cent. Where there\nare injuries in connection with al\ncoholism the mortality is 50 per cent.\n"The cases we handle are-complications\nof pneumonia and \'wet brain\'\nand injuries. They are in a large\npercentage, and yet our death per\ncentage is very much lower than sta\ntistics" given by other institutions,,\nwhich is entirely due to the long ex\nperience our physicians have had in j\nhandling alcoholic cases, and. we feel\nthat fthis is the logical place to bring\nthose cases since other hospitals\' do\nnot want to handle them."\nMr. Whitman went over with me\nwhat the doctor had said regarding\nthe treatment they give, and the fact\nthat it is a recognized ethical treat\nment, and, as I left him, I saw a man\nleaving the hospital\' whoni I remem\nbered having seen shortly before\nChristmas endeavoring to sell some\nvery clearly written stories for the\nprice of a few drinks. Dr. Sceleth\nwas talking to him.\n"Try to keep in condition," the doc\ntor said.\n"I will, doctor," the man answered.\n"I feel fine now and I\'m going to try\nto keep this way.

While the "prickly 1\nsensation" described by the medicine\nfakir was not named, the terrors of\nthe disease were,', 'Moore was convinced that he had\nit and had -it bad. For several\nmonths, whenever any unaccustomed\npressure came upon a certain part of\nhis back a sharp stinging pain re\nsulted. Oh, it was there! He was\ngoing to die! He felt it, he knew it,\nand he told his daughter Ruth so.\nHe was so distressed and positive\nthat she became alarmed.\n"I don\'t see why you don\'t send for\na doctor," she said.\n"Who shall I send for?" snapped\nthe irritated invalid. "There\'s only\nDoctor Parton and none of him,\nnot if I die for it! No, sir-ree!"

He said this to me me,\nJohn Moore, whose forefathers\nbrought Plymo.uth Rock over to this\ncountry!"\nRuth made no reply to all this.\nThe speech renewed a sunny memory\nin her mind. She and Dr. Parton had\nbecome quite good friends during the\ntime he had attended her father.\nWhen the latter had dismissed him\nin anger they did not see very much\nof each other. However, they had\nmet incidentally several "times. The\nyoung physician seemed inclined to\nrenew the acquaintanceship and\nRuth was glad to realize it.\nTwo days later Mr. Moore changed\nhis" mind. He would see Dr. Parton.\nIt was a reluctant direction he gave\nfor his presence and when the young\nphysician arrived he received a de\ncidedly chill and" sulky greeting.\n."I have sent for you not to ex\namine me or tend on me," said the\nold man bluntly. "I have got a fatal\ndisease. I know what it is and what\nwill cure it. I sent for you because,\nyou being a doctor, probably know\nwhere to get a rare remedy I need."\n"What is the remedy?" inquired\nDoctor Parton. Now he had seen i\nRuth only the evening previous. He\nhad told her that he considered that\nher \'father was more scared than ill.\nRuth had told of the "symptoms" her,\nfather had described and the doctor.,\nhad smiled "to himself.\n"It\'s radium," replied Moore.

Sure enough, when the doctor\npressed it Moore uttered a frightful\nhowl of pain. The doctor, too,\ncaught a sharp stab in the finger.\nHe smiled queerly.\n"I will be here with the remedy to\nmorrow, Mr. Mqore," he\' said:\nWhen the young physician appear\ned as promised, with an impressive\nair, he placed a little phial done up in\nelaborate coverings of cotton, silk\nand metal. Of course this was the\nradium, Moore decided.\n"Now, sir," said Doctor Parton, "I\nshall have to give, you a light anaes\nthetic. Then I will apply the rem\nedy." To this Moore agreed. Once he\nwas under the influence of the drug,\nthe doctor took out a tiny pair of\nsurgical pincers. He pressed the\nJjaws of the instrument to the center\nof the ailing spot and drew out a.\nneedle.\nIn some way the little tormentor\nhad got under the flesh and this was\nthe cause of the "fatal symptoms."\nReally and truly Doctor -Parton\nrubbed the contents of the phial over\nthe spot, so he could say later that he\nhad applied "the remedy."', 'And tlien the artful young physi\ncian left the house after few words\nwith Ruth.\nThe next day John Moore was\n"well."

And of course it\nprevents "them from ever becoming\nreally "big."\nAs an example of this colossal ego\ntism the assumption that the w.orld\nhangs breathlessly on their words\nand actions I remember one young\nster with whom I sat in a box at the\ntheater, watching a Lillian Russell\nAFRESH" FIGHTERS\nIREE\'S DUTIES\nperformance.\nWith the utmost assurance he ask\ned the usheV to go behind the scenes\nfor a specially requested song.\n"Just tell Lillian that I want her\nto sing it," he said, with a wave of\nhis hand. \'\nNeedless to say there was no re\nsponse. Lillian Russell probably had\nnever even, heard of this second rater\nbefore.\nAnother, when his fighting was\ncriticized by the dean of sport writers\nin this country, announced in a \'huff\nthat he was "going across the con\ntinent to see that guy\'s managing\neditor and have him fired."\nAnd if you undertake to be frank\nwith this type of ringster, you may\ncount on his being your enemy for\never.

That is assisting the fallen bat\ntler, as I interpret the rules.\nHe must arise within 10 seconds\nunassisted.\nThe prostrate man has no more\nright to know how much time he has\nleft before being counted out than he\nhas to ask the referee or timekeeper\nhow many minutes remain in a given\nround. ;\nIt is giving him an advantage not\ncontemplated by the rules.\nHe knows just how long he may\nrest upon his knee before getting up;\nhow long he has to recuperate.\nThe way time should be counted is\nthe method employed by the Old Cali\nfornia Club in San Francisco, where\nthe timekeepers were in a gallery 35\nfeet away. At the expiration of the\n10 seconds a gong was rung. The\nfallen man, not knowing how much\ntime he had left, got up as quickly as\nhe could when knocked down.\nUnder the present practice of\ncounting, the battler, who has gone to\nthe mat turns to watch the referee.\nOn his knee, he can wait five, six,\nseven seconds, as the case may be,\nbefore rising, and then lunge at his\nadversary, go down again and. get\nanother period of recuperation,\nknowing just how long to wait.\nHe is thus , decidedly assisted. He\ncan stall. Otherwise he would resume\nfighting as quickly as he could regain\nhis feet. And that is wnat the rules\ncontemplate.\nNor has a referee any right, ac\ncording to the rules, to lay hands on\nfighters.

I', 'NEW MUNICIPAL COURT PLAN IS DANGEROUS\nTO DEFENDANTS\nAttacks on the municipal court act\nwill be made till the-end of the cam\npaign by all trade union speakers and\nlabor sympathizers.\nThey charge that it has some of\nthe most cunning jokers ever slipped\ninto a legislative measure. What the\nact means is not shown in any way\non the little ballot to be voted on at\nthe next election. The question sim\nply reads:\n"For the act entitled, \'An Act in\nRelation to the Municipal Court of\nChicago.\' "\n"Against the act entitled, \'An Act\nin Relation to the Municipal Court of\nChicago.\' "\nIt was passed by the legislature last\nJune. The referendum on election\nday will either endorse it and put it\ninto effect as a law right away on the\nday after election or it will be killed\nand that will be the end of it.\nFifty-two law book pages are\ntaken up by the many long words and\ncunning jokers of the act. Two points\nare marked as especially vicious.\nThey provide:\n1. That a policeman shall have\nthe power to arrest citizens without\nwarrant even though the policeman\nhas hot seen the arrested citizen do\nan unlawful deed.\n2. That the grand jury shall be\nabolished for all felony cases except\ntreason and murder.\nWilliam B. Rodriguez, delegate to\nthe painters\' district council and al\ndermanic candidate in the 15th Ward,\nholds that the act is a frame-up by\nanti-labor interests and is "crooked\nas a dog\'s hind leg." He said: "It\ngives the Chicago police power to\nstop peaceful picketing in any part of\nthe city. Without any sworn com\nplaint, without an affidavit of any\nkind, the police and state\'s attorney\nare given power ,of arrest and" trial.\nIf the police and other elected offi\ncials don\'t like a picket maintained\nby labor during a strike they can haul\nthe pickets away by wagonloads to\nany station in the city. Exactly the\nunlawful things done by the police\nto the waitresses in front of Hen\nrici\'s are by this act made legal.\n"If they can find one judge in the\ncity who is an Employers\' Association\nman they can rush the arrests and\nbring prisoners before this judge and\nhave their own way. No feature of \'\nthe act is more vicious than the one\nthat gives policemen the right to ar\nrest without warrant.\n"The language of the act is, \'Any\nperson arrested without warrant\nshall without unnecessary delay be\ntaken by such officer to some con\nvenient branch of the municipal\ncourt and such police officer shall\nthereupon make and file a complaint\nin writing .and such defendant shall\nthereupon be dealt with according to\nlaw in such manner as if he had been\narrested in the first, instance under a\nwarrant lawfully issued.\'\n"This little joker is just the kind\nof law John M. Glenn and Fred Job\nand John Vogelsang and William M.\nCollins would find handy in their\nbusiness. The same lobbyists of the\nRestaurant Keepers\' Association who\nsmothered a six-day law for women\nat Springfield had a hand in this mu\nnicipal court act.\n"Take notice that after a police\nman has made an arrest \'without\nwarrant,\' he is merely required to\n\'make and file a complaint in writ\ning.\' He does not have to swear to\nhis complaint. He can charge strik\ners or pickets with anything he\npleases and he is not liable for per\njury." v\nGrand juries are quietly wiped off\nthe map so far as a big majority of\ncases are concerned in Section 56.\nIt orders: "Before an information is\nfiled by any other person other than\nthe attorney general or the state\'s\nattorney, one of the judges in the\nmunicipal court shall examine the-in-', 'formation and may examine the per\nson presenting the same and shall\nsatisfy himself that there is probably\ncause for filing the same."\nIn place of a grand jury of 23 mem\nbers who shall satisfy themselves\n"that there is probable cause," one\nlonely peewee corporation judge is\ngranted the power by this proposed\nlaw.\nAt Chicago Federation of Labor\noffices it is predicted that the act will\nbe voted down at the polls. In the\n1908 election a joker was discovered\nin a proposed law which would re\nquire all wage earners to take out a\ncity license.

It\nwill be a pleasant labor to this judge.\n"The subject of\' boy offenders has al\n.ways been one near to his heart.\nWhen the judge arrived at the\ncourt this morning he found the\nbench banked with flowers. Man so\ncieties had sent large floral offerings.\nProminent Chicagoans. filled the\ncourtroom. At 9:30 the court was so\n: crowded that the doors were ordered\n-closed by Deputy Bailiff Daniel Cur-ran.\nChief .Justice Olson made the open\ning address and outlined the purpose\nof the court, which\' is the handling of\nall cases against boys between 16 and\n\'21 in an effort to save as many as\n\'possible from -being held-to the grand\nJury; and lying in the county jail until\ntheir innocense or guilt is established.\nJudge Scully\'followed Olson.\n"We live in an age of civilization\nrwhere it is possible to see little boys\n10 or 12 so hounded after their first\noffence that they end on the gallows,\n\'raising their dying voice agains.t the\nimpalpable thing known as the law,"\nhe said.\n? "This court "will stand for the prin\nciple that the young Bhould be saved,\nmot punished\'. It will not be for the\nabatement of the accused, but for his\njres\'toration to good standing in so\nciety that made him go wrong."\nt Ass\'t City Prosecutor George L.\nReker praised the selection of Judge\nScully as the presiding justice of the\n-court.\n"Your honor," he said, addressing\nJudge. Scully, "this court will be more\n-important than any other in the city,\njror to you will come boys with their ,\ncharacter in the making. There may\nbe a future Shakespeare or Lincoln\nbrought in before you. And it\'s up to\nyou to decide their future. And I\nknow that in after years when\nthey\'ve grown up they\'ll think of you\noften and it won\'t be as Judge Scully\nbut as \'Big Brother Tom.\' "\nMrs. Joseph T. Bowen said there\nwere 10,000 boys between the ages of\n16 and 20 arrested in 1912. In 1913,\nshe said, there were 1,261 boys in the\ncounty jail, and out of this number\n804 were first offenders.\n"And out of 218 boys held to the\ngrand jury recently there were only\n107 indictments," she continued\'.\nFather P.

The\nfirst boat\'s, I remember, long before\neven sailing vessels were thought of,\nwere used in ancient Egypt, and were\nregularly formed boats constructed\nof sawn plapks of lumber. They were\nlong, galleys and the motive power\nwas furnished by "galley slaves."\nThe Phoenicians were most -enterprising\nin navigation and in 604 B. C.\ncircumnavigated \'the continent of\nAfrica, using a mast and a single\nsquare-sail in addition to slave pow\ner. The Romans paid Vry little at\ntentions to navigationMintil forced to\ndo so by their rivals, the Carthagin\nians. On the, ir boats the galleys, rang\ned from a single bank to five banks\nof oars. In the first Punic war the\nRoman fleet consisted of 330 vessels,\neach containing 300 rowers and 120\nsoldiers.\nShips intended only for merchant\npurposes were first built by the Geno\neseand not until the beginning of the\n14th century were sails used by them.', 'ADMITS HE PAID RETAINER IN\nPANAMA CANAL BILL DEAL\nWashington, March 18." Admis\nsion that he had paid Clarence W.\nDeKnight, alleged lobbyist, a retainer\nof $1,000 and promised Tirana contin\ngent fee if he succeeded in having\nthe provision forbidding use of the\nPanama canal to railroad owned\nships stricken from the \' Panama\ncanal bill, was made to the Senate\nlobby committee today by Former\nRear Admiral F. T. Bowles, president\no fthe Fore River Shipbuilding Com-,\npany.\n"If you are interested," DeKnight\nwrote Bowles on March 18, 1912, "I\nshall be glad to assist in attempting\nto have this provision kept out of the\nbill. Of course, I would want a retain\ner fee of say $1,000 and a contingent\nfee of $4,000 in the \'event that the\nprovision is not enacted into law."\nBowles said he accepted this pro\nposition\' and filed with the committee\nhis letter so advising DeKnight. The\nlatter then wrote Bowles that he had\ngotten in touch with Representative\nKnowland of California,, whomV he\nsaid he "knew quite well," and who\nwould lead the\' fight against the provision.\nFATHER DORNEY LAID TO REST\nWHILE THOUSANDS MOURN\nThe packing house district today\npaid a remarkable tribute to the late\nFather Dorney of St. Gabriel\'s\nchurch, spiritual ruler of the stock\nyards, who died Sunday.\nForty thousand packing house em\nployes suspended operations for five\nminutes while requiem mass was be\ning said by Archbishop Quigley.
