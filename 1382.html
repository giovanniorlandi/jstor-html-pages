FERTILIZERS AND FIELD CROP*.\nThe Fourth of a Series of Six Articles\nDavid Dickson, after a life of useful service to his fellow-man and a\nlife of success as a farmer, had the following to say about the use of\nguano: “I say that farmers can make every acre of their land rich if they\nwill. Providence Intended the earth should increase in fertility as rapidly\nas it does in population. Every man that assists in removing this dor\nmant guano, lying idle and useless on the Chincha Islands, and puts it in\ncirculation, creating therewith food and clothing, is a benefactor to his\nkind. The country suffers for want of a snare of the surplus fertilizing\nmaterial. Remove the deposit and apply to crops, and it will enrich Uie\nland.”\n“I commenced to use guano in-184G, and gradually increased the use of\nIt until tlie present time, never having omitted to use it on my crops\nexcepting the last year of the war, when 1 could not obtain It. With the\nproper system of rotation of crops, and returning all the crops to the land,\nexcept the lint of the cotton, land may be improved with Peruvian guano\nalone, but. uot so fast as when you combine with the soil all the ele\nments of the plants to be grown. Ammonia being necessary for all plants.\nI know of no crop that it would not benefit. It will pay the best upon\nthose crops that bring the most money—cotton being that crop in this sec\ntion and tobacco in other sections."\nIt will be seen from the above that Mr. Dickson profited greatly by the\nuse of guano. He knew well the value of ammonia to growing crops, but\nyou will observe that he knew’ quite as well the value of other plant foods\nto the crop. lie got better yields when he applied all the elements of plant\nfood than when he appJiod ammonia alone. Also observe that he considered\nit good business to apply fertilizer. He was a business man as well as a\nfarmer, and knew’ all the keen points in the business world.\nView* of Another Millionaire Farmer.\nThe Hon. James M. Smith, another millionaire fanner of Georgia, who\ndied only a few weeks ago, had the following to say with reference to\nthe use of fertilizers on faim crops:\n‘ The use of fertilizers has become one of the most important factors in\nSouthern agriculture. Tt. is a powerful agency in producing an increased\nyield—a thing we should desire and work for. We certainly believe in the\nuse of commercial fertilizers, but we also believe in the turning under ot\n•vegetable matter, the sowing of legumes and the saving of all barnyard ma\nnure. The up-to-date farmer will not consider one of these, but all four of\nthem, in trying to increase his farm crops.”\nEach of these two farmers, who have done much to stimulate farm im\nprovement. learned the value of fertilizers, but learned equally well the value\nof diversified farming. They would not decrease the use of fertilizer, but\ndiversify more. They would have ns use more fertilizers, so that we could\ngrow more plants and vegetable mater, in turn plow this under, and in\nthis way increase the fertility of our lands. The most effective farming of\ntoday involves these two great principles. Use fertilizers and diversify the\norops. Rotate and feed the plants, and you will increase your yields, be more\nsecure from plant diseases, and bring your farm into a high staie of cultiva\ntion.\nPut Back Plant Food In the Soli.\nIf growing crops take plant food out of the soil and we do not plow un\nder an amount equal to this, or get It from some other source and apply it.\nour land is sure to decrease in fertility and in value. This is a fact beyond\ndispute. With most of our crops we take from the fields a large amount of\nnitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash, which never goes back, to the place on\nthe farm from whence it came. We should see to It, then, that, some kind of\nplant food takes ite place. In the case of cotton, we sell the seed, and with\nthem large amounts of nitrogen and other elements of plant food. Very of\nten we burn the stalks, and in this way take from the field much more\nvaluable plant faod. It la sucidal policy for us to remove from the soil more\nplant food than we restore to the soil.\nOn a sandy farm in one of the Southern States, which had abandon\ned by its original owner and sold for fifty cents per acre, a litttle barnyard\nmanure and heavy applications of fertilizer made another farm rich. The lasi\nfarmer used sls worth of fertilizer per acre and raised 1.400 pounds of seed\ncotton per acre. This was about a bale per acre on the entire farm. The sls\ninvestment in fertilizers and good breaking and cultivation netted the thrif\nty fanner more than SSO per acre when cotton was bringing a high price.\nAll the experiment stations and other institutions have found that ferti\nlizers applied to farm crops under good conditions pay a handsome dividend\non the investment. It generally means the converting of a non paying fafm\nInto a profitable farm. This, after all, is what, we farm for, for profit as well\nas some pleasure. The average farmer gets large returns for fertilizers wisely\nused. If fertilizers do not always pay. It is because farmers waste instead of\nvse them.\nDrink to Blame.\nCaptain L. P. Pinkston of the\nV. S. Marine Corps has compiled\na table showing that of all appli\ncants for enlistment in this coun\ntry last year only 9.31 percent\n: inet the physical requirements\nfor military service—an average\nof one man in each eleven exam\nlined. Alcoholic liquors, with\nphe vices engendered by their\nuse —by even their moderate use\nt— are. say authorities in and out\nof the army, chief cause of this\nincapacity on the part of Amen\nfas young manhood. It is evi\ndent that if the nation is to sue\ntrlve we must guard its people\nIfrom the toe now permitted to\niprey upon our citizenship—a foe\nlevhich in the name of govern\n|ment itself is undermining our\nichief defences. The hour has\n•struck for nationwide prohibition\nLof the liquor traffic. There is no\n(neutrality here. Every man\nland woman is either for or against\nithe war now on for the defense\nlof home and national life.—Ex.\nI The Oktibbeha County School\n■Board will meet at the Court\nHouse at 10 o’clock Monday,\nEypril 10th, 1916.\n■\' C.

We are in favor of giv\ning the governor a chance; he\nha* not had it as he should.\nCedar Bluff, Miss ,March 27\nMr. Editor:\nTHE CHURCH.\nChrist said to Peter, “Upon\ntins rock 1 will build my church;\nand the gates of hell shall not\nprevail against it.” The word\nrock here is translated from the\nGreek word Petros, meaning a\nstone or a rock. It is in the\nfeminine gender. It signifies a\nfirm foundation. The feminine\ngender is here used in the sense\nof a fixed rock, solid in its bed;\nwhile the masculine gender Is\nused in the sense of a detached\nrock, or one without a solid foun\ndation. So the feminine gender\nbeing used here, it signifies a\nsolid foundation of faith and\nconfession, Christ was to build\nHis church.\nThe word hell here is translat\ned from tlie Greek word, Hades,\nwhich was, among the Greeks,\nthe place of departed spirits. It\nalso signified the lowest condi\ntion after death. Hades was the\ngod of the under world. His\ncharacter was described as fierce\nand inexorable. The ensign of\nhis power was a staff, with which\nhe drove the shades into the\nlower world. Being king of\nthe lower world, tie was consid\nered ihe giver of nil the bless\nings that come from the earth,\nhence he gave the metals con\ntained in tlie earth, and was call\ned Plato.\nThe word church here is trans\nlated from the Greek word Ec\nclesia. which meant an assembly\nor together of any\nkind, either secular or religious.\nIt was not an organization of\nmen. It was only a gathering\ntogether of people at one parti,\ncular time. It is used in the\nNew Testament as an assembly\nfor worship, and also designates\nthe body of those being accus.\ntoraed to meet from time to time\nIt spoke ot those being accus\ntomed to meet at various times\nas an Eoclesia or a church. It\nwas also used in the New Testa\nment todesignale the whole body\nof Christian believers. And we\nhave no record anywhere where\nit is referred to as an orgamza\nlion of Christian believers. It\nwas referred to as an assembly of\nChristian believers, and not a\nformal organization as wo have\n*oday, such as Baptist, Metho\ndists, Presbyterians etc. I will\ndefy any man to prove that they\nhad any formal organization of\nChristian believers in the Apos\ntolic age. And I will defy any\nman to prove that Christ or His\napostles ever established any\nformal organization of Christian\nbelievers. Theie is no record\nthat on the Day of Pentecost or\nthereabout that any formal or\nganization was established. The\nLord added unto the church or\nassembly such as should believe.\nThe fact of their believing added\nthem to the assembly of believ\ners providing they remained with\ntne assembly. No formal organ\nization is spoken of at all. When\nChrist said to Peter, “Upon this\nrock, 1 will build my church”.\nHe meant upon this solid foutida\ntion of faith and confession I will\nbuild my Christian believers\nThe foundation of faith and con\nfession is what my followers\nstand on. But we have no proof\nanywhere that he referred to any\nformal organization of any kind.\nBur someone may ask the ques\ntion; What differnce does it make v\nIt makes a great big difference\nwhen these denominations of to\nday claim to be the church of\nJesus Christ? It is every true\nbeliever in Jesus Christ as a\npersona) Savior. Paul did not\ntell the jailor to go and join\nsome organization. He told him\nto believe on the Lord Jesus\nChrst and he should be saved.\nThe denominations today claim\nto be the representative ol Jesus\nChrist on earth. Sorry repre\nsentative it is, fall of swindlers\nand dead beats and deepest dyed\nimmoralists of all descriptions.\nThe church of denominations to\nday are running after the world,\nthe flesh and lha devil, and call\nsuch as that the Church ot Jesus\nChrist. Such claims are pre\nposterous and blasphemous\nagainst the Son of God. We find\nno warrant in Scripture for such\npretentious claims. The church\norganizanons may be all right as\nan organization. It has done\nand is doing som° good work;\nbut its claim to be the represen\ntative of Jesus Christ on earth is\na fraudulent deception that needs\ncorrection.\nYours Sinceiely,\nE. C.

In both cases\nyoij simply waste what has been in\nvested.’ If you stop too soon you\nwill get a rotten egg instead of a\nchicken.\nAdvertise something out of which\nyou may reasonably expect returns,\nand when you have found what to\nadvertise , take care that you place\nyour copy in a newspaper that can\nturn the trick. Don’t delude yourself\nwith a china doorknob, and don’t\nconfuse a “rooster newspaper,’* which\nspends its time cock-adoruming, for\na “hen newspaper” that is too busy\nhatching out dollars to strut about\ncrowing.\n(Opyrtffht. 1998, by Tribuna Cacapaay Gfcta***?\nShurden-Reed.\nThe second marriage perform\ned by Supervisor Jesse Neely at\nDouble Springs occurred Sunday\nafternoon.

Good evening.\nBULBS IN A BOWL\n1\nAn Easy Way to Cultivate Miniature\nFloating Gardens.\n▲ novel way of growing bulbs, such\nas crocuses, has been tried with good\nsuccess. After securing the bulbs the\nnext thing is to get one or two rather\nlarge corks. Through these holes are\nbored and the bulbs fitted into the\nopenings in such a waf that the under\nside, from which the roots spring. Is\nnear the lower part of the cork.\nNow obtain a large shallow bowl and\nfill this with pure water. Float the\ncorks, with the bulbs In place, on the\nsurface and set the whole aside\nIn a rather shady position for two or\nthree weeks. At the end of this time\nit will be noticed that the roots are\ngrowing down into the water; thence\nforward a place in a sunny window\nshould be selected.\nThe upper shoots of the bulbs will\nstart to grow rapidly, and at this time\nIt Is a good plan to arrange a little\nmoss to hide the upper surface of the\ncorks, or. If preferred, however, grass\nor some other seed, such as cress, may\nbe sown to provide a green covering.\nThere is nothing to do but to keep\nthe bowl well supplied with water and\nchange this now and again. Finally\nthe flowers emerge, and then the effect\nis extremely pretty. The bulbs may be\nplanted in this way any time up to\nearly January, though naturally the\nsooner they are started the earlier they\nwill bloom.—S. Leonard Bastln In St.\nUlcholas.\nVICTORIA’S LETTERS.\nRoyal Secrets That Are Stored Away\nin Buckingham Palace.\n“We may wonder if the world will\never be allowed to see the private cor\nrespondence amassed by tlie late Queen\nVictoria.*’ says a writer. It is stored\naway in a strong room built into the\nwalls of Buckingham palace, and the\nqueen shared her confidence with no\none.\nSo long as she was physically able to\ndo so she opened and closed the safe\nherself and arranged Its contents\nWhen she was too feeble to do this she\nemployed an old and trusted secretary,\nbut even he had t work under the\nroyal eye He was never allowed to\nkeep the keys uor t> read the letters\n(hut he handled.\nQueen Victoria was always a volumi\nnous letter writer, and she was in con\nstant communication with most of the\nroyalties in Europe.

There\nare a number of books that we habitu\nally pretend we have read which we\nhave never read at all. They are great\nbooks, we suppose. At least we’ve\nheard a lot about them and read a lot\nabout them, and people who assume to\nknow say they are great books. Some\nof them we have tried to read and\ncouldn’t read, bat we have pretended\nat one time or another to have read all\nof them. Here is our list of shame:\n“Tom Jones/* We have tried to read\nit four times and could never get five\npages Into it.\n“The Vicar of Wakefield/’ We have\nattempted it at least six times and\ntaken the count in the first round\nevery time.\n“Dante’s Divine Comedy,” Wejiare\nbeen going against the Cary transla\ntion. which we hear is a good one, at\nleast once a year for twenty years, and\nwe can’t get interested in it. Yet up\nto the present moment we have always\npretended that we had read all of it\nand liked it.\n“Don Quixote.” We have read a lit\ntle of it, and we know all the usual\nthings that are said about it, and we\neven wrote some stuff about it one\ntime, saying all the things that are\nusually said about-it, for which we got\n$25. but we don’t really like it. It puts\nus to sleep; it seems long drawn out\nand clumsy to us.\n“Boswell’s Life of Johnson.” We\nnever read any of it. But we have pre\ntended to and have pretended at times\nto quote incidents from It and have got\naway with the incidents.\nWe have always pretended that we\nwere familiar with Walt Whitman’s\npoetry, but as a matter of fact we\nnever read anything through, except\ning “When Lilacs Last In the Door\nyard Bloomed.’’—Don Marquis in New\nYork Sun.\nTHE TREE ON THE ROOF.\nAn Old Building Custom to Propitiate\nthe Pagan Gods.\nDid you ever stop to think why a bk\nof ornament in the form of conven\ntionalized fruit, grain or flowers is al\nmost invariably added to the gable ot\na Gothic building and very frequently\nto the gable of any other type of build\ning V Do you know why the lightning\nrods of our grandfathers were branch\ned at the ends like little trees and why\nthe old fashioned Scandinavian, Dan\nish and German contractors contrive\nto fasten a branch of a tree or an ear\nof corn to the topmost peak of a house\nthat has progressed so far in the course\nof construction that the rafters are in\nplace? Usually the contractor laughs\nsheepishly when he is asked about the\nmatter, giving no other reason than\nthat bis father always provided the\nbirds with some grain or offered them\na green branch to rest in.\nThe fact is that the birds nave noth\ning whatever to do with the custom.\nIt is purely religious in its significance\nand entirely pagan, it had its begin\nning before Christianity was “inflicted\non tli** barbarians of the north.” The\ngable o? a building was exposed to\niK/th wind and lightning, so the gods\nmust be propitiated. For Wotan there\nwas a small evergreen tree and for\nThor there was a bunch of flowers. If\nthe favor of the god had been invoked\nwhile the house was still Incomplete,\nthe ceremony must be finished the day\nthe house was done by the burning of\nthe little tree or the withered flowers.\nThen a bunch of grain was tied to the\ngable to feed the white horse of the\ndeath god, so that he would hasten on\nhis journey without stopping at that\nparticular house.—St. Louis Globe-Dem\nocrat\nHomemade Gas.\nSpanish peasants living In the cork\noak region* use homemade gas obtained\nfrom cork refuse. As described by one\nauthority, the process consists in fill\ning several large teakettles with the\nwaste bark and placing each In turn\nover the fire during the evening, horn\ning the volatile gas as it escapes from\nthe spouts The carbonized residue\nforms the fine black-brown pigment\nknown to commerce as “Spanish\nbrown.”\nHis Golf Prize.\nWhen the Duke of York was living In\nEdinburgh In 1681 he was told that a\ncertain shoemaker named Patersone\nwas the best golf player in Scotland,\nand him. the duke, later James 11.,\nchose as partner in a foursome, win\nning a huge stake. He promptly turned\nover the money to Patersone, who\nforthwith built a house In which the\nduke placed a stone with a Patersone\ncrest bearing the motto, “Far and\nSure.”\nAlways Wrong.\nManager—l’m disgusted with the.\nmistakes that new man makes.!
