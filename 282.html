According\ntoAad A. Tone of Northome,\nLang took the oath of office and\nqualified as commissioner. How\never, he did not attempt to parti\ncipate ia the assembling of the\nboard.\nIt so happens that there are\ntwo factions on the board, two\nbeing on each side, and neither\nfaction will give way to the other,\nwith the result that it has been\nimpossible to elect a chairman of\nthe board or transact any busi\nness whatever. After "sparring"\nfor two days, it was agreed to\nadjourn until January 25, -tend\nAad A. Toneof Northome, a mem\nber of the boara, was in the city\nyesterday on his way home from\nthe meeting at the "Rapids."\nMr. Tone states that about the\nonly manner in which relief can\nbe obtained is by legislative ac\ntion, and it is proposed to have\na bill passed at the present ses\nsion of the legislature to have\naiother commissioner (possibly\nto be designated as "at large")\nwho can sit with the present\nfour members of the board and\nfacilitate the transaction of busi\nness. ___^\nDOINGS IN THE VARIOUS\nCHURCHES OF THE CITY\nHours of Worship and Subjects of Ser\nmons to Be Delivered in the\nCity Tomorrow.\nSt. Phillips Catholic church.\nEearly mass 8:30 a. m. high\nmass and sermon 10:30.

Laying great stress upon the\ncolonial enterprise of Germany and\nthe development of her colonies Herr.\nDernburg said:\n"The German colonial question is\nthe question of the future of national\nlabor, the question of the bread of\nmillions of industrial workers and the\nquestion of the employment of Ger\nman capital in trade, production and\nnavigation."\nIn the presentation of the facts lead\ning up to these conclusions Herr Dern\nburg said that the English speaking\nnations of the world in the middle of\nthe Eighteenth century numbered 9,-\n000,000 and the German speaking na\ntions at the same period numbered\n20,000,000. Today 120,000,000 spoke\nEnglish and only 70,000,000 speak Ger\nman. Germany had lost a position of\nrelative importance in the world be\ncause she had no colonies and was de\npendent more than e\\*er on other coun\ntries for raw materials and food sup\nplies.\nHerr Dernburg described the rapid\ndevelopment of the United States and\nits increasing economic importance\nand commercial Influence throughout\nthe Western hemisphere to the detri\nment of European nations.\nOn the subject of colonization Herr\nDernburg said that while the greater\npart of African colonies were not\nadapted to colonization by Europeans\nGerman Southwest Africa and the\nhighlands of East Africa contained\nareas twice as large as Germany\nwhich could be settled by Europeans\nand large areas were also available in\nthe South sea colonies.\nGAR-GOL \'SK\nS0RETHR0AT\nPrlco 33C\nOWL DRU STORE\nThMramrt!HeOall Patten* sold IntfceUnhei\nStates than of any ther maka f pattern*.

The French Catholics\nmust be prepared for all sorts of trials,\nbut they were certain of final victory.\nThis meant the maintenance of their\nunion with the Holy See, which was of\nthe greatest importance, as shown by\nthe efforts of the enemies of the\nchurch to dissolve this union.
