Warrick was born on 4 Dec. 1940 and grew up on a\nfamily farm in southern Iowa. He received a B.S. degree in mathematics\nfrom Iowa State University in 1962 and completed a M.S.\nand Ph.D. in soil physics under Don Kirklam also at Iowa State.\nGraduate studies were completed in 1967. In the fall of 1967 he\narrived at the University of Arizona in Tucson and has continued\nthere except for a sabbatical leave at the University of CaliforniaDavis.\nDr. Warrick teaches courses in soil physics and soil water dy-\nnamics. He is currently major professor or thesis advisor for 8 graduate\nstudents in soil science and hydrology. He's been thesis advisor\nfor 18 former graduate students.\nDr. Warrick's major areas of research are in theoretical soil physics\nand the mathematical description of soil water flow, transport\nphenomena and variability of soil spatial properties. Most recently,\nemphasis is on describing water status with trickle irrigation and\napplication of geostatistics to soil systems.

MULVANEY\nRichard L. Mulvaney was born 16 Sept. 1952 in Champaign, IL.\nAfter graduating from Ottawa Township High School (Ottawa, IL)\nin 1970, he entered Illinois Valley Community College in Oglesby,\nfrom which he received the A.A. degree, summa cum laude, in 1972.\nHe then enrolled in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,\nwhere he majored in agricultural science, and was awarded the B.S.\ndegree in 1974. He was the recipient of the Outstanding Senior\nAward in agronomy in 1974 and graduated as a Bronze Tablet Scholar\nwith the highest ranking in the College of Agriculture.\nHe began work on his M.S. degree in 1974 at Iowa State University\nin Ames under the supervision of John M. Bremner. His research\nfor this degree dealt with the use of various compounds to retard\nthe hydrolysis of urea applied to soils as a fertilizer, and it led to\nthe publication of two journal articles, he completed his M.S. work\nin 1977 with a major in soil microbiology and biochemistry. Following\nthis, he served as a research associate in the Agronomy De-\npartment for a year and a half. During this period, he continued to\nconduct research relating to the use of urea as a fertilizer, and he\nassisted in the preparation of two review articles on this subject,\nwhich were subsequently published as book chapters.\nIn 1979 he enrolled in the Graduate College of the University of\nIllinois to pursue a Ph.D. degree in soil fertility and chemistry under\nthe direction of L. Touby Kurtz. His research dealt with the use of\n15N tracer techniques to study denitrification and other processes\nthat lead to gaseous loss of nitrogen (N) from soils as dinitrogen\n(N2) and/or nitrous oxide (N2O). He developed a new method for\ndetermination of 15N-labeled N2O with a dual-in Jet ratio mass spectrometer,\nand he used this method in conjunction with a method\npreviously developed for determination of 15N-labeled N2 to establish\ntrends in evolution of N2 and N2O associated with the wetting\nand drying of soils and to assess the relative significance of nitrification\nand denitrification as sources of the N2O evolved from\nNH/-fertilized soils. The results of this work indicate that N2 and\nN2O evolved from NHJ-, as well as NO3~-fertilized soils originate\nlargely, if not entirely, through denitrification of NOf under anaerobic\nconditions, and they suggest that evolution of these gases\nfollows an overall cycle associated with wetting and drying of the\nsoil. Very little, if any, N2 and N2O appears to be evolved when the\nsoil moisture content is well below field capacity. Evolution virtually\nceases when the soil is saturated by rainfall, and it subsequently\nincreases as the soil dries, with maximal evolution occurring several\ndays after the rainfall. Evolution then decreases and eventually ceases.\nDr. Mulvaney completed work on the Ph.D. degree in 1983. During\nhis graduate education at the University of Illinois, he spent\ntime as a teaching assistant, was selected as a Wright and Hunter\nfellow in agronomy, and was a recipient of the Agronomy Department's\nLang-Aldrich Award. He is a member of Gamma Sigma\nDelta, Alpha Zeta, Sigma Xi, and Phi Kappa Phi and is active in\nthe ASA and SSSA.\nDr. Mulvaney joined the faculty at the University of Illinois in\nJune, 1983, as assistant professor of soil fertility. He teaches a graduate\ncourse on the chemistry of soil fertility and is continuing his\nresearch interests in denitrification and other aspects of N in the\nsoil-plant system.\nSoil Science Award\nMORRIS SCHNITZER\nMorris Schnitzer was born in Bochum, West Germany, on 4 Feb.\n1922. He was a resistance fighter against the Nazis during World\nWar II in Holland, Belgium, and France. He immigrated to Canada\nin the spring of 1947 and began his university studies in the fall of\nthat year. He received his B.Sc. in soil and plant chemistry in 1951,\nhis M.Sc. in soil chemistry in 1952, and his Ph.D. in soil chemistry\nin 1955, all from McGill University in Montreal.\nFrom 1955 to 1956 he worked as a research and development\nchemist for the Aluminium Company of Canada. He joined Agriculture\nCanada in 1956. He spent the year 1961-62 on a transfer of\nwork in the Organic Chemistry Department of Imperial College of\nScience and Technology in London, England, where he familiarized\nhimself with methods and approaches of natural products chemistry.\nHe has been a principal research scientist in Agriculture Canada\nsince 1973; was program leader of soil chemistry and biotogy research\nfrom 1978-82, and is now program leader of soil nitrogen\nand organic matter research. Dr. Schnitzer is a fellow of ASA, SSSA,\nand the Canadian Society of Soil Science. He has authored or coauthored\n225 refereed publications, including 17 book chapters, and\nhas co-authored Humic Substances in the Environment and co-edited\nSoil Organic Matter and Interactions of Soil Minerals with Nat-\nural Organic and Microbes. He has also written several encyclopedia\nchapters and many articles for nontechnical publications.\nDr. Schnitzer has lectured at numerous Universities and scientific\ninstitutes and participated in symposia and scientific meetings on\nsoil science in Canada, the USA, the West Indies, Argentina, India,\nIsrael, the USSR, France, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, West Germany,\nand the Netherlands. He has directed the research of many\nvisiting scientists and Ph.D. students from around the world. Dr.\nSchnitzer has advised the Canadian International Development\nAgency with regard to improving the fertility of tropical volcanic\nsoil in the West Indies and served as consultant to the International\nJoint Commission (Canada-USA) in connection with the possible\npollution of boundary waters of the Great Lakes by agricultural\nactivities. He is a founding member of the International Humic\nSubstances Society and serves on its executive board and is also on\nthe executive board of the International Society of Biogeochemistry.\nHe was chairman of Commission II (Soil Chemistry) of the International\nSociety of Soil Science from 1978-82.\nDr. Schnitzer's major contributions are in the area of soil organic\nchemistry, with special emphasis on the chemical structure of humic\nPublished March, 1985\n", '506 SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J., VOL. 49, 1985\nsubstances and the reactions of humic substances with metals and\nminerals. He has developed and improved methods for the extraction,\nfractionation, and characterization of humic substances. These\nmethods are now widely used in soil organic matter laboratories.\nDr. Schnitzer\'s most important contributions to soil science are\nhis investigations on the chemical structure of humic substances in\nwhich he used a variety of chemical and spectroscopic methods.\nThese researches have attracted wide international attention. He is\none of the pioneer soil scientists in applying sophisticated and advanced\nmethods to structural studies on humic substances. His ex-\ntensive use of colloid-chemical methods and of electron microscopy\nto shed light on the shapes, sizes, weights, and other molecular\nproperties of humic substances are especially noteworthy. On the\nbasis of his studies, Dr. Schnitzer has prop9sed the following structural\nC9ncept for humic materials: the basic "building blocks" are\nphenolic and benzenecarboxylic structures heavily substituted by\nCOOH and OH groups; the structural units are held together by Hbonding;\nmost of the alkanes, fatty acids, carbohydrates, and ni-\ntrogenous components of humic materials are adsorbed on the\n"building blocks". In a series of experiments Dr. Schnitzer demonstrated\nthat, following removal of the adsorbed components, the\nbasic structural network remained intact. He also showed that in\ndilute aqueous solutions, the humic "building blocks" aligned to\nform structures which had the characteristics of flexible, linear polyelectrolytes.\nOther areas of soil research to which Dr. Schnitzer has contributed\nvery significantly are metal- and clay-humic interactions. These\ninteractions include the formation of water-soluble simple and mixedligand\ncomplexes, sorption and desorption, dissolution of minerals,\nand adsorption on external mineral surfaces and in clay interlayers.\nOf special interest to soil scientists are his studies on interactions\nof fulvic acid with montmorillonite.\nRecently, Dr. Schnitzer has devoted much attention to identifying\nmajor components of the "unknown" soil nitrogen which constitutes\nabout 50% of the total soil nitrogen.\nWhile Dr. Schnitzer\'s research is aimed at a better understanding\nof the role of humic substances in soils and waters, his findings\nprovide important clues to the solution of practical problems in\nmany areas of soil science.\nDr. Schnitzer is a member of the editorial boards of Soil Science,\nGeoderma, Agrochimica, and Plant and Soil.\nBouyoucos Soil Science Distinguished\nCareer Award\nPHILIP F. LOW\nPhilip F. Low was born 15 Oct. 1921 in Carmangay, Alberta,\nCanada. In 1940 he became a U.S. citizen and began attending\nBrigham Young University. Three years later, he received his B.S.\ndegree in absentia, after having joined the U.S. Army Air Corps to\nserve in World War II. Following an extended period of training in\nmeteorology at the University of New Mexico and the California\nInstitute of Technology, which granted him an M.S. degree, he forecast\nthe weather for military aircraft being ferried to Russia along\nthe Alcan Highway. When the war was over, he entered Iowa State\nUniversity on a graduate fellowship and was awarded the Ph.D.\ndegree by that institution in June 1949. After working for the USDA\nfor 5 months in Las Cruces, N.M., he accepted an appointment as\nassistant professor in the Agronomy Department of Purdue University.\nHe has remained there until the present time, being pro-\nmoted to associate professor in 1952, and to professor in 1955.\nDr. Low has presented seminars throughout this country and at\nmore than 30 institutions in 12 foreign countries. He has participated,\nby invitation, in symposia sponsored by approximately 25\ndifferent organizations representing many scientific disciplines. He\nwas the guest of honor at one of these symposia (sponsored by the\nUniversity of Sydney) and another (sponsored by the Department\nde Science du Sol, I.N.R.A., Versailles, France) was held so that he\nand his French colleagues could compare and reconcile their results.\nOn four occasions he has been an invited speaker at Gordon Research\nConferences treating different subjects, namely: the Geo-\nchemistry of Water, Organic Geochemistry, Water and Aqueous\nSolutions, and Chemistry at Interfaces. At the request of the American\nChemical Society, he organized a symposium on the Colloidal\nProperties of Clays which was held at the spring 1982 meeting of\nthe Society.\nFor short periods of time, Dr. Low has been a visiting professor\nat: the University of California (Berkeley), North Carolina State\nUniversity, University of Florida, University of the South (Bahia\nBlanca, Argentina), Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Rehovot, Israel),\nthe Water Technology Center of the Indian Agricultural Re-\nsearch Institute (New Delhi, India), the Nanking Institute of Soil\nScience (Nanking, China) and the University of Sydney (Sydney,\nAustralia). Also, he has served as a consultant for: Tennessee Valley\nAuthority, U.S. Salinity Laboratory, International Atomic Energy\nAgency, U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory,\nBattelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, Mobil Oil Co.,\nPhillips Oil Co., Amoco Oil Co., Cities Service Oil Co., and Exxon\nProduction Research Co. His C9nsulting with the latter company\nhas extended over a 25-year period.\nMany honors have been bestowed on Dr. Low. In 1960, he received\nthe Annual Research Award of the Purdue Chapter of Sigma\nXi. Three years later, the American Society of Agronomy elected\nhim a Fellow and awarded him its Soil Science Achievement Award.\nIn 1968, he received a Distinguished Visitor Award to Australia\nwhich allowed him to lecture throughout that country on subjects\nof his own choosing. In 1976, his alma mater, Brigham Young University,\ngave him a Distinguished Service Award. In the same year,\nhe was elected a Fellow of the Spil Science Society of America when\nits Fellows program was established. Four years later, in 1980, he\nreceived the prestigious Herbert Newby McCoy Award which is\nbestowed annually by Purdue University for extraordinary contributions\nto science. Then, in 1983, he was named a Thurburn Visiting\nFellow at the University of Sydney. In addition to these honors, Dr.\nLow has had the distinction of serving the Soil Science Society of\nAmerica as chair of Div. S-2 in 1964, as president of the Society in\n1973, and as a member of the Visiting Scientists Panel for three\nsuccessive years. Further, he served as Associate Editor of Clays\nand Clay Minerals from 1960 to 1965 and is currently serving as\nconsulting editor for Soil Science and Geoderma.\nDuring his career, Dr. Low has been the major professor for 6\nM.S. students, 20 Ph.D. students, and 13 postdoctoral students. Also,\nhe has taught a graduate-level course on the Physical Chemistry of\nSoils which has been unique in its quantitative, physico-chemical\ndescription of the subject.\nDr. Low\'s research has dealt with the colloid and surface chemistry\nof clays and he has published approximately 100 journal ar-\nticles. He was responsible for the concept that clays dissociate into\ntheir component ions and have a solubility product and he performed\nthe first experiments showing that osmosis can occur through\ncompacted clays. Also, his papers on the release of aluminum by\nhydrogen clays, the thermodynamics of clay-water systems, and the\ndiffusion of ions in such systems are among the first written, and\nmost definitive, on these subjects. However he is best known for\nresearch relative to his hypothesis that the interaction of water with\nthe surfaces of clay particles has an in-depth effect on the properties\nof the water and, thereby, on the swelling of the clay. Despite serious\nopposition to this hypothesis, he has worked persistently for more\nthan 30 years to test it adequately. As a result, the hypothesis has\nbeen verified and many processes that occur in the earth\'s crust\nhave been elucidated.\nSoil Science Distinguished Service Award\nDON KIRKHAM\nDon Kirkham was born 11 Feb. 1908 in Provo, UT. He attended\npublic schools in Salt Lake City, UT and Berkeley, CA. During high\nschool and his first year at the University of Utah he also studied\nmusic, graduating as a clarinetist from the McCune School of Music,\nSalt Lake City, in 1926. As a youth he worked summers on farm\nland owned by his father. He spent 2 1/2 years in Germany as a\nmissionary for his church in 1927-30 and then continued his education\nat Columbia University in New York City. Columbia Uni-\nversity awarded him the A. B. degree (with Honors in Physics) in\n1933, the A. M. degree in 1934, and the Ph. D. degree in 1938. He\nwas awarded an honorary doctor\'s degree by the Royal Agricultural\nUniversity, Ghent, Belgium, in 1963.\nFrom 1938 to 1940 he was instructor and assistant professor in\nmathematics and physics at Utah State University. Here, through\nhis colleague, Professor Willard Gardner, he became interested m\nsoil physics research and published several articles. During the years\nof World War II (1940-46) he served as a civilian scientist with the\nU. S. Navy, working on the research physics of anti-mine warfare.\nHis naval work included designing, setting up, and operating an\nanti-magnetic mine program for all vessels using New York harbor.\nIn 1946 he headed a group of Navy physicists at the Bikini Atom\nBomb Tests.\nDuring the war years, in addition to his Navy work, he continued\nstudy in theoretical soil problems and publication of articles. In 1946\nhe joined the staff of Iowa State University as associate professor\nof agronomy and physics, and was made professor in 1949. In 1959\nhe was appointed C.F. Curtiss distinguished professor of agriculture,\n', 'SSSA FELLOWS AND AWARDS-1984 507\nthe distinguished professor title being this institution\'s highest recognition\nfor faculty excellence.\nHe has had two Fulbright lectureships, one in The Netherlands,\n1950-51, and one in Belgium, 1957-58, where he also was a Guggenheim\nFellow. Other extended foreign assignments were in Tur-\nkey, 1959, as a land reclamation adviser; in Egypt, 1961, as a land\nreclamation consultant and lecturer at Alexandria University for the\nFord Foundation; and in Argentina, 1965, as a member of the U.\nS. AID team studying universities. He has given lectures and served\nat conferences in many other countries. In September and October\nof 1982 he was visiting professor at Hohenheim-Stuttgart University\nin Germany.\nHe is author or coauthor of over 200 scientific articles, several of\nwhich have received merit awards, and is coauthor (with W. L.\nPowers) of the book Advanced Soil Physics. He has often reviewed\nfor scientific journals and fulfilled assignments on national and international\ncommittees. He has been president of the Iowa State\nSigma Xi chapter, president of the Osborn Research Club, and program\nchairman of 59!! physics at VII Congress of the International\nSoil Science Society in Madison, 1960. In 1952 he won the Stevenson\nAward and in 1961 gave the 25th anniversary soil physics lecture\nfor the SSSA. He was named Fellow of ASA and SSSA in 1957 and\nHonorary Member of SSSA in 1982. He shared the 1983-84 Wolf\nPrize in Agriculture for his "pioneering mathematical and physical\nanalysis of the movement of water in the soil to the benefit of mankind."\nHe was director of the Iowa State Water Resources Research In-\nstitute from 1964-73. After 1973 he continued to carry on a full\nprogram of teaching and research. He was named professor emeritus\nin 1978 and is involved in soil physics research and in work with\ngraduate students.\nTHOMAS M. MC CALLA\nThomas M. McCalla is a retired soil microbiologist from the USDA\nAgricultural Research Service and professor emeritus of agronomy,\nUniversity of Nebraska. He was born 29 Nov. 1909 on a farm near\nCorinth, MS, graduated from Biggersville high school in 1930 as\nvaledictorian of his class. As a youth he worked on his father\'s farm.\nIn 1934 he received a B.S. degree in chemistry and microbiology\nfrom Mississippi State University and then transfered to the University\nof Missouri where he received a M.S. degree in 1935 and\nPh.D. in 1937. From 1937 to June 1941 he was a full-time instructor\nin microbiology at Kansas State University.\nIn June 1941 Dr. McCalla joined the USDA and University of\nNebraska, Lincoln, until his retirement 1 Jan. 1980. He began his\ncareer by working with F. L. Duley and Prof. J. C. Russel in pioneering\nresearch on stubble mulching. He was probably the first\nsoil microbiologist to investigate the soil microorganisms in reduced\ntillage (compared to plowing). Results of this work showed reduced\ntillage (compared to clean tillage) increased the number of microorganisms\ndifferentially near the soil surface, immobilized more N,\nand often reduced N availability to crops. His research also showed\nthat certain phytotoxic effects may result from leaving crop residues\non the soil surface, and he identified some of the phytotoxins involved.\nKnowledge gained from this research serves as a base for\ncurrent research on reduced tillage.\nAfter the retirement of Dr. Duley, research leader of this group\nof scientists for about 20 years, several soil scientists, microbiologists,\nagricultural engineers, and crop physiologists were added to\nthis team to enable them to develop multidisciplinary approaches\nto their research. Also in 1965, when a national concern for protection\nof the environment was developing, Dr. McCalla and the\nscientists in his unit initiated a research program to evaluate factors\naffecting nutrient losses from feedlots and to develop technology to\ncontrol such losses. Again he and colleagues conducted pioneering\nresearch on the microbiology of feedlots, resulting nutrient transformations,\nand methods of controlling these transformations. Re-\nsults obtained were basic for development of management guidelines\nby action agencies such as EPA and SCS. This research has\nreceived national and international prominence for its contribution\nto knowledge on this subject.\nFollowing the work on livestock waste and development of methods\nfor controlling pollution from feedlots, before retiring he assem-\nbled a research team to evaluate the chemical, physical, microbiological\nand plant responses of conservation tillage systems.\nDr. McCalla has served as major advisor for over 40 Ph.D. students\nand a number of postdoctorate and visiting scientists. He is\nauthor or co-author of over 200 publications. He has chaired symposia\non tillage and livestock waste. He has served in numerous\nprofessional offices and committees for University of Nebraska, Great\nPlains and North Central Regional Committees, American Society\nof Agronomy, Soil Science Society of America, Soil Conservation\nSociety of America and USDA. In 1977 he was one of the delegates\nof Agricultural Specialists of the National Academy of Science that\nvisited Peoples Republic of China for a study on Vegetable Fanning\nSystems of China. He has served as ASA lecturer and invitational\nlecturer to numerous groups at universities, special interest groups\nin this country and abroad.\nHe is a fellow of ASA, SSSA, Soil Conservation Society of America\nand American Association for the Advancement of Science and previous\nrecipient of the ASA Agronomic Research Award, Presidents\nCitation Award of Soil Conservation of America, the Nebraska\nGamma Sigma Delta Merit award, and awards by the Livestock\nEnvironment Science Committee of the American National Cattlemen\nAssociation for Environmental Control Programs.\nWAYNE H.

SOC. AM. J., VOL. 49, 1985\nSSSA Honorary Member\nRENE J. TAVERNIER\nRene J. Tavernier was born on 26 Aug. 1914 in Nevele (Belgium).\nIn 1931 he enrolled at the State University of Ghent (Belgium) where\nin 1935 he obtained the diploma of "licentiate" in Geology, in 1941\nthe Ph.D. degree with "the Greatest Distinction". In 1938 he studied\nsoils in Wageningen (The Netherlands) under the late Prof. Edelman,\nand became "assistant" at the Geological Institute of the State\nUniversity of Ghent. After the liberation of Belgium in September\n1944 he was appointed "docent" (associate professor) and in 1948\nbecame professor of Physical Geography and Regional Pedology.\nIn 1950 he attended the 4th Congress of the International Soil\nScience Society in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) where he was an\nactive member of the "Committee on Rules". At that occasion he\nwas elected president of the International Society of Soil Science.\nHis early work was mainly on periglacial morphology and sedimentary\npetrology. He was the first one to recognize the occurrence\nof fossil periglacial features—such as cryoturbation—in Belgium. His\ninterests had by then shifted towards soil survey and soil classification\nand in 1947 he was nominated head of the Soil Survey Section\nof the University of Ghent, in 1950 he assumed the responsibility\nof the Soil Survey of Belgium, which by now has been completed.\nIn 1950 he also started studying tropical soils in Zaire, in order to\nprepare for the 5th Congress of the International Society of Soil\nScience, to be held in 1954 in Leopoldville (the present Kinshasa).\nSince 1951 he became actively engaged with the USDA Soil Conservation\nService for the preparation of Soil Taxonomy and organ-\nized a series of meetings at which the various approximations of\nsoil taxonomy were discussed with the leading European soil scientists.\nIn 1963 he founded—and became director-^)? the Interna-\ntional Training Centre for Post-graduate Soil Scientists of the State\nUniversity of Ghent, where up to the present some 500 students,\nmainly from developing countries, have been trained in soil science.\nHe is the author or coauthor of more than 200 research papers,\nmainly on soil classification and soil genesis of both temperate and\ntropical soils. He is also co-author of two books and of several\nchapters in monographs such as the second edition of the Multilingual\nVocabulary of Soil Science, of FAO (1960); of Volume V\n"Europe" of the FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World, at scale 1:5\n000 000; of the explanatory text and map of the FAO countries of\nEurope at scale 1:2 500 000; of the soil map with explanatory text\nof the European Economic Commission of the Common Market at\nscale 1:1 000 000 (now being printed); and of a book on Soil and\nWater Conservation in Belgium. He has served as major advisor\nfor over 50 Ph.D. students and over 20 postdoctoral scientists.\nHe has always had a keen interest in the development of soil\nscience in the LDC countries and used to be a coordinator of various\nsoil research and teaching projects such as in Zaire, Cameroon, Algeria,\nZambia, Malaysia, etc.\nHe was a visiting lecturer at numerous foreign universities in\nEurope as well as abroad.\nHe was one of the founders of the Belgian Society of Soil Science\nand acted as its secretary-general from 1950 to 1958.\nHe was named honorary dean of scientific research by the King\nin 1950, received the Government\'s Decennial Award for Earth\nSciences in 1969, and the Medal of Recognition of both Ghent and\nLiege State Universities.\nHe is a working member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of\nBelgium, of the Royal Belgian Academy of Overseas Sciences, and\na corresponding member of the Swedish Academy of Agriculture.\nFor helping realize the soil map of the Grand-Duchy of Luxemburg\nthe title of "Commandeur de 1\'Ordre du Merite" was bestowed\non him. He is also a member of the Advisory Panel of ACSAD for\nthe realization of the 1:1 000 000 soil map of the Arab countries.\nIn 1980 he received the USDA Certificate of Appreciation "for\nmaterial assistance in developing soil taxonomy and promoting its\ninternational use, mainly in the less developed countries, through\nteaching and consultations, and in causing it to be accepted as a\nmeans of international communication in soil science."\n']</pre>
