Tong1, Si-Hyun Kim2, Ik Gyun Im3, and Nan-Yao Su1\nAbstract\nClimate change impacts the current and potential distribution of many insects, since temperature is often a limiting factor to where the insects can \nsurvive. The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), has never been reported in South Korea \ndespite its close proximity to 2 countries (China and Japan) where this economically important pest has been reported. This may be due to the average \nwinter temperature in South Korea which is below 4 °C, the lower limit of the current distribution range of Formosan subterranean termite. However, \nwith climate change leading to increased temperatures, South Korea may be susceptible to successful invasion by Formosan subterranean termite. \nThe objective of this study is to estimate the future possible distribution of Formosan subterranean termite in Korea based on temperature. Climate \ndata from Korea showed a significant increase of 2.19 °C per 100 yr in average annual temperature from 1910 to 2018. Previous and current average \nwinter temperatures were higher than 4 °C only in Jeju, and most provinces did not exceed 4 °C, except for some southern cities such as Busan in \n2000 to 2019. With the estimated rate of temperature rises, winter temperatures in Gyeongsangnam-do will exceed 4 °C starting from 2020, and \nJeollanam-do will exceed 4 °C from 2060. Coupled with the statistically significant, increased annual trade between Korea and other countries (China, \nJapan, Taiwan, and the USA) where C. formosanus is currently distributed, we predict that Formosan subterranean termite will become established \nin South Korea, probably starting from a southern trade port such as Busan.\nKey Words: global warming, invasive species, species distribution, urban pest\nResumen\nEl cambio climático tiene un impacto sobre la distribución actual y potencial de muchos insectos, ya que la temperatura es a menudo un factor \nlimitante a donde los insectos pueden sobrevivir. La termita subterránea de Formosa, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), \nnunca ha sido reportada en Corea del Sur a pesar de su proximidad a 2 países (China y Japón) donde se ha reportado esta plaga de importancia \neconómica. Esto puede ser debido a la temperatura media de invierno en Corea del Sur, que está por debajo de 4 °C, el límite inferior del rango de \ndistribución actual de la termita subterránea de Formosa. Sin embargo, con el cambio climático que conduce a un aumento de las temperaturas, \nCorea del Sur puede ser susceptible a una invasión exitosa de las termita subterránea de Formosa. El objetivo de este estudio es estimar la posible \ndistribución futura de la termita subterránea de Formosa en Corea en función a la temperatura. Los datos climáticos de Corea mostraron un aumento \nsignificativo de 2,19 °C por 100 años en la temperatura media anual desde el 1910 hasta el 2018. Las temperaturas medias invernales anteriores y \nactuales fueron superiores a 4 °C solo en Jeju, y la mayoría de las provincias no superaron los 4 °C, excepto en algunas ciudades del sur como Busan \nen el 2000 hasta el 2019. Con la tasa estimada de aumento de temperatura, las temperaturas invernales en Gyeongsangnam-do superarán los 4 °C a \npartir del 2020, y Jeollanam-do superará los 4 °C a partir del 2060. Basado en estadísticamente significativo, ademas de mayor comercio anual entre \nCorea y otros países (China, Japón, Taiwán, y EE.UU.) donde se distribuye actualmente C. formosanus, predecimos que la termita subterránea de \nFormosa se establecerá en Corea del Sur, probablemente a partir de un puerto comercial del sur como Busan.\nPalabras Clave: calentamiento global; especies invasoras; distribución de especies; plaga urbana\nClimate change is an inevitable phenomenon and has had a significant\nimpact on species extinction and the introduction of invasive \nspecies. Invasions by alien species in non-native areas due to climate \nchange are important driving factors that affect ecosystems and biodiversity\n(Vitousek 1994; Dukes & Mooney 1999). These invasive spe-\ncies often have an enormous economic impact on agriculture, the environment,\nand structures, as well as losses from regulatory actions \nand trade restrictions (Holmes et al. 2009). The total economic loss by \ninvasive species in the USA, for example, is estimated around USD $120 \nbillion (Pimentel et al. 2005).\n', '432 2020 — Florida Entomologist — Volume 103, No. 4\nIn addition to climate change, human activities translocate species \nbeyond their native range, which has increased substantially during the \nlast centuries. Hence, globalization and increase of trade are responsible\nfor spreading alien species into non-native areas. This is related to \npropagule pressure, defined as a measure of the number of individuals \nreleased into a non-native region, and consists of the propagule size, \nnumber of individuals per release event and number, and number of \ndiscrete release events (Lockwood et al. 2005). Propagule pressure is \nnot easy to measure directly, but can be estimated by using international\ntrade as a proxy (Westphal et al. 2008).\nThe Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki\n(Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), is one of the world’s 100 worst inva-\nsive alien species (Lowe et al. 2000), and is the most-studied termite \nspecies due to its economic importance in temperate and subtropical \nregions. The nest of C. formosanus may be found either underground \nor inside trees, and the mature colony contains millions of individuals \n(King & Spink 1969; Su & Scheffrahn 1988). The foraging distance of C. \nformosanus may be up to 100 m using underground tunnels or aboveground\nshelter tubes (King & Spink 1969).\nThe global economic loss, including control and repair costs, \ncaused by subterranean termites is USD $32 billion annually (Rust & Su \n2012). Formosan subterranean termite is endemic to southern China \nand Taiwan (Kistner 1985; Su & Tamashiro 1987; Li 2000; Su 2003; Li \net al. 2009), and has been introduced to multiple locations, including \nJapan (Su & Tamashiro 1987), South Africa (Coaton & Sheasby 1976), \nMarshall Island, Midway Island, and the US (Su & Tamashiro 1987; Su \n2003; Evans et al. 2013). Past and current distribution of C. formosanus \nin the world showed that it is restricted to an area about 35° north and \nsouth of the equator (Su & Tamashiro 1987).\nDespite the fact that South Korea is located between ca. 33° to \n38° north and between China and Japan, there is no official record of \nFormosan subterranean termite in South Korea. These 2 neighboring \ncountries have known distributions of Formosan subterranean termite \nand have a long history of damage by this pest (Mori 1987; Wang et \nal. 2002). The distribution of C. formosanus in South Korea is controversial.\nEarly work by Lee et al. (1998) reported finding C. formosanus \nfrom 3 southern locations: Busan, Jinju, and Geoge Island. However, a \nlater extensive survey of the same areas failed to find C. formosanus in \nKorea (Lee et al. 2015). The reason it is controversial is that firstly, Lee \net al. (1998) did not include any pictures of the specimens. Secondly, \nthey stated that they confirmed the presence of C. formosanus based \non damage, which is unreliable. Lastly, if it was present in 1998, the \ndamage by C. formosanus also should have been reported elsewhere. \nHowever, there was no such reports yet. Officially, only 2 species of \nsubterranean termites were found, Reticulitermes speratus kyushuensis\nMorimoto (Becker 1969) and Reticulitermes kanmonensis Takemat-\nsu (both Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) (Lee et al. 2015).\nTemperature is the crucial factor responsible for the distribution of \nC. formosanus (Kofoid 1934; Shimizu 1962; Coaton & Sheasby 1976; Su \n& Tamashiro 1987). The distribution of this species in Japan is limited \nto regions where the monthly mean temperature of winter is above 4 \n°C (Abe 1937; Mori 1987). However, C. formosanus also was discovered \nin Kanagawa Prefecture (Japan), where the temperature drops lower \nthan 4 °C in the winter (Mori 1987).\nConsidering the geographical proximity of South Korea to China \nand Japan, we hypothesize that the temperature may not have been \nfavorable to Formosan subterranean termite in the past, but is likely \nto become suitable in the future due to climate change, especially in \nthe southern part of South Korea. To project the potential future areas \nthat may be threatened by Formosan subterranean termite in South \nKorea, we surveyed the amount of imported wooden materials and \nthe amount of trade between South Korea and other countries where \nFormosan subterranean termite is currently distributed (i.e., Japan, \nChina, Taiwan, and the US) as a proxy of propagule pressure. Further, \nwe analyzed past and current temperatures to find the trend of temperature\ndue to climate change and average winter temperatures to \ndetermine the possible distribution limits of Formosan subterranean \ntermite in South Korea if it is introduced. Furthermore, the future distribution\nlimit with the consideration of temperature increase rate was \nestimated.\nMaterials and Methods\nSTUDY AREA\nRepublic of Korea (South Korea) occupies the southern half of the \nKorean Peninsula, which was divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone \nafter the Korean War in 1953. The land mass of South Korea is approximately\n100,000 km2, and it has about 2,500 km of coastline (Fig. \n1). There are 9 provinces, the first-level divisions within the Republic of \nKorea. In this study, we assigned letters to the provinces for simplicity \n(A to I, from south to north and from east to west) (Table 1).\nSouth Korea has a temperate climate with 4 distinct seasons (winter:\nDec–Feb; spring: Mar–May; summer: Jun–Aug; fall: Sep–Nov).

During the summer, there are summer monsoons with occasional\ntyphoons.\nINDIRECT MEASUREMENT OF PROPAGULE PRESSURE\nWe surveyed the amount of imported wooden materials, including \nraw logs, lumber, and timber, and possible transportation sources of \ntermites, from 1995 to 2017 (Korea Forest Service, Statistical Yearbook \nof Forestry [https://www.forest.go.kr/]). We were not able to acquire \nthe exact amounts of imported wooden materials from China, Japan, \nTaiwan, and the US. Instead, we examined the amount of annual trade \nfrom 2000 to 2018 between Korea and these other countries where C. \nformosanus is currently distributed, because they are potential sources \nof future introduction events into the Korean Peninsula (Korea Customs\nService trade statistics [https://unipass.customs.go.kr]).\nTable 1.

All data are accessible and available on the internet (https://\ndata.kma.go.kr/). Using the climate data from 3 stations, we calculated \nthe average, minimum, and maximum annual temperatures from 1910 \nto 2018. We also analyzed the average winter temperature, defined as \nthe average temperature in Dec through Feb from 1960 to 2019 using \ndata from 3 to 7 stations for each province (Table 1).\nWe estimated future temperatures based on the increase rate of \nthe average annual temperatures. On average, the temperature increased\n2.19 °C per 100 yr; therefore, the increase rate for 20 yr was \ndetermined to be 0.44 °C. Therefore, the future temperature was calculated\nby adding 0.44 °C to previous temperatures.\nMAPPING AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nCountry/province shapefiles from GADM (https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html)\nand elevation raster imagery from the USGS \nEROS Archive - Digital Elevation - Shuttle Radar Topography Mission \n(SRTM) 1 Arc-Second Global (https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/\nSRTM3/Eurasia/) were used to create the map (ArcMap 10.5.1, Environmental\nSystems Research Institute, Redlands, California, USA).\nPearson’s correlation coefficient test was used to determine the \nstatistical correlations between the amount of imported wooden materials,\namount of trade between the Republic of Korea and other \ncountries, average annual temperatures, average annual minimum \ntemperatures, average annual maximum temperatures, and yr. All statistical\nanalyses were carried out using SPSS v19.0 (IBM Corp. 2010).\nResults\nThe amount of imported wooden materials significantly increased \nbetween 1995 and 2017 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.764; P < \n0.001; Fig. 2A). In addition, the amount of trade between South Korea \nand China (r = 0.964; P < 0.001), Japan (r = 0.629; P = 0.004), Taiwan \n(r = 0.982; P < 0.001), and the US (r = 0.922; P < 0.001) statistically \nincreased over time (Fig. 2B).\nOverall, there were significant increases in average annual (r = \n0.804; P < 0.0001), minimum (r = 0.859; P < 0.0001), and maximum \n(r = 0.658; P < 0.0001) temperatures from 1910 to 2018 (Fig. 3). In \nSouth Korea, previous and current average winter temperatures were \nhigher than 4 °C, which is the northern temperature limit of C. formosanus\nonly in location A. Most locations (i.e., B to I) do not exceed 4 °C, \nexcept some cities in location B, such as Busan, Namhae, Geoje, and \nTongyeong between 2000 and 2019 (Fig. 4). Future estimated winter \ntemperatures of location B, however, exceed 4 °C after 2020, and those \nof location C will exceed 4 °C by 2060 (Fig. 5).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we revealed that the Formosan subterranean termite,\nwhich is the most economically important termite, possibly will \nbe found in southern regions of the Korean Peninsula due to climate \nchange. Coptotermes formosanus is known as an urban pest due to its \npropensity to be found in man-made wooden structures such as houses\nand historical properties (Lowe et al. 2000; Rust & Su 2012; Evans et \nal. 2013). This invasive termite has never been completely eradicated \nonce it becomes established in an area (Su 2003).\nTo predict the distribution of species, several climate variables have \nbeen used (Guisan & Zimmermann 2000; Beaumont et al. 2005). The \nvariables, minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures are some of \nthe basic components to project future distribution. Accordingly, most \nstudies that predict the distribution of subterranean termites also applied\nair temperatures, although subterranean termites are soil-dwell-\ning insects (Li et al. 2013; Tonini et al. 2014; Buczkowski & Bertelsmeier\n2017). This is because soil temperatures are closely related to \nair temperatures, and may be predicted from air temperatures (Toy et \nal. 1978; Zheng et al. 1993).\nIn temperate latitudes, low temperature has a significant impact on \nrange expansion, and affects insect survival and development (Robinet \n& Roques 2010). For instance, the northern distribution limit of the \nsouthern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann (Coleoptera:\nCurculionidae), is determined by lower winter temperature (Un-\ngerer et al. 1999). Studies on the distribution of Formosan subterranean\ntermite indicate that the lower limit in winter temperature (about \n4 °C) is the most important factor responsible for its distribution (Kofoid \n1934; Abe 1937; Shimizu 1962; Coaton & Sheasby 1976; Mori 1987; Su \n& Tamashiro 1987; Su 2003). In the past (i.e., 1960 to 1999), there was \nno area with suitable tempertaure in Korea except Jeju Island (location \nA, Fig. 4). The rise in winter temperatures in southern parts of Korea, \nsuch as coastal areas in southern regions (locations B and C), may allow \nFormosan subterranean termite to become established in the future \n(Fig. 5). Additionally, we speculate that if the temperature rises at the \nsame rates that we observed for the past 100 yr, Formosan subterFig.\n2.

Arrows indicate a linear equation and R-square of the trend line.\n', 'Lee et al.: Potential pest status of the Formosan subterranean termite 435\nranean termite also may expand its distribution farther north in the \nfuture (Figs. 5, 6), with the possible exception of mountainous sections \nof the central and northeast regions (Fig. 6), due to the relatively low \ntemperatures at high elevations.\nAside from rising temperatures, anthropogenic activities may provide\nfavorable conditions for establishment of Formosan subterranean \ntermite colonies in urban areas. For instance, heating systems in structures,\nas well as moisture-related conditions around structures, such \nas rain seepage, plumbing leaks, condensation, and poor ventilation, \nmay supply enough heat and moisture for termites to survive (Mallis \n& Story 2003). Accordingly, it is possible that these kinds of favorable \nconditions may alter our projections.\nThe natural rate of spread of termites is relatively slow because of \nthe time required for colony maturity (Chouvenc & Su 2014) and low \ndistance of the dispersal flights (about 0.2 to 1 km) by alates (winged \nreproductives) (Messenger & Mullins 2005; Mullins et al. 2015). The \nminimum distances from areas in China and Japan where Formosan \nsubterranean termite is known to occur to South Korea are 543 km \nFig. 3. Annual temperature of Korea based on 3 stations (Busan, Daegu, and Seoul) from 1910 to 2018. Solid, dashed, and dotted lines are the average, minimum, \nand maximum, respectively.

Considering these distances, we can \nexclude the possibility of natural dispersal from either China or Japan \nto South Korea. Therefore, Formosan subterranean termite most likely \nwill be introduced either by trade of goods, such as in shipping containers,\nraw logs, timber, and lumber, or by boats to port cities (Su 2003), \nwhich is the same way Formosan subterranean termite has invaded \nother countries. Incipient colonies of Formosan subterranean termite \nare able to seal off the nest after tunneling into wet wood, allowing \nthem to survive during transportation. We showed that the amount of \nimported wooden materials significantly increased over time, as well \nas the amount of trade between Korea and countries where Formosan \nsubterranean termite is currently distributed (Fig. 1A, B).\nAlthough environmental factors, such as temperature, are suitable, \ninvasive species need to survive in interspecific competition with native\nspecies (Su 2013). Therefore, competition can be another limit-\ning factor to the establishment of invasive species in non-native areas. \nHowever, it is believed that Formosan subterranean termite is more \naggressive and usually out-competes different species such as Reticulitermes\n(Su 2003). Formosan subterranean termite has not shown \nantagonistic behavior towards colonies of other conspecific colonies \nin introduced areas, e.g., Florida, USA (Su & Haverty 1991), and C. formosanus\nmay fuse with other colonies (Lee et al. 2019).\nBusan, the second largest city in Korea, located in the southern \ntip of the Korean Peninsula, has the largest port in Korea and acts as \na point of entry for invasive alien species. The pine wood nematode, \nBursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner and Buhrer) Nickle (Secernentea: \nParasitaphelenchidae), which is the agent for pine wilt disease, was \nfirst found in Busan in 1988, and spread to most mountains in South \nKorea, resulting in an average USD $8 million per yr in control programs \n(Shin 2008). A tropical/subtropical species of hornet, Vespa velutina \nLepeletier (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) also was found first in Busan in \n2003 (Kim et al. 2006), and is distributed in locations B and C (Fig. 1) \nas of 2010 (Choi et al. 2012). The hornet is now well-adapted to and \nhas become a pest in urban environments (Choi et al. 2012). Another \ninvasive species, the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren \n(Hymenoptera: Formicidae), native to central South America, has been \nfound recently in Busan Port in 2018 (Choi et al. 2018). Furthermore, \n10 different macro-moths of subtropical origin were found in Korea in \n2006 (Park et al. 2006).\nBuczkowski and Bertelsmeier (2017) showed that under the RCP \n4.5 scenario in 2050, the future distribution range of C. formosanus \nwill expand north to North Korea. However, our study showed that C. \nformosanus may not survive if it is introduced in the northern region \nof South Korea due to low winter temperatures. Buczkowski and Bertelsmeier\n(2017) incorrectly assumed that C. formosanus is currently \ndistributed in South Korea.\nIn conclusion, with the rise of temperature due to climate change and \nthe increase of trade between South Korea and other countries where Formosan\nsubterranean termite is currently distributed, Formosan subterra-\nFig. 5.

Otherwise, \nFormosan subterranean termite will cause damage in the southern \nregion of South Korea as they already have done in other countries.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Thomas Chouvenc (University of Florida) for providing\nconstructive comments.
