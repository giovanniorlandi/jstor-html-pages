The great\nprophet!\n, One of the most highly favored\nby the Lord Ged with visions of\nfuture events Daniel! The\ntrue prophet! It is absolutely\ntrue tthat his prophecies have\nbeen faithfully fulfilled as the\ntime has arrived for fulfillment.\nHistory has recorded the actual\nhappening of all the events fore\ntold by Daniel, except his visions\nof the "latter days," and events\nof the present time clearly indi\ncate that these visions ate new\nbeing fulfilled.\nAnd the Apostle Jehn! Anether\ngreat prophet, given wonderful\nVisions aud commanded te re\ncord them. In one of his visions\nhe graphically pictures events\nthat are of world-wide signifi\ncance in these days.\nComparatively few people of\nour war-smitten world realize\nthat the Prophet Daniel and the\nApostle Jehn many centuries\nage actually taw panoramic\nviews of momeuteus happenings\nof the present time and recorded\nthem for future generations.\nThis old world wags along\nfrom day te day and month te\nmonth and year te year, accept\ning whatever comes in a matter-of-fact\nway, net realizing that\nthere is a controlling hand run\nning through it all.\nThe world knows of these\nprophets, and rather passively\naccepts their statements. It\ndoes net study the word pic\ntures, but in a self-satisfied way\nconcludes that they, of course,\nrefer te ether periods of time.\nWe have no prophets today\nTh.s is net prophetical age. We\nare net supposed te be prophets\nin order te understand the pre\npbecies that have been recorded.\nAll may read and study them,\nand if the time is due, they may\nbe mere readily comprehended.\nTe establish absolute confidence\nin all Daniel\'s visions of the rise\nand fall of \'nations, we should\nunderstand that his prophecies\nwere written hundreds of ytars.\nbefore the occurrences of events\nconcerning any but the very first\nof them, and that historians, pro\nfane as well as sacred, concede\nthe actual fulfillment of all down 1\nte the latter days. The fact\nthat the prophet accurately fore\ntold events covering the last\n25oe years is sufficient basis for\nserious speculation as te the ful\nfillment of the last.\nFollowing Daniel\'s description\nof the beast with ten horns, con\nceded as representing the Eu\nrepean nations that followed the\ncollapse of the Reman Empire,\nthe great prophet\'s vision swift\nly passes te events of the pres\nent age, which he introduces\nwith the words "there came up\namong them another little horn "\nThat is, another little horn (or\nnation) came up among the ten\nhorns (or nations.)\nPrussia is net one of the king\ndoms that came out of the Ro Re\nman Empire, but it came up\namong these nations, and devel\noped into the German Empire\nonly forty-six years age. Ger\nmany\'s wonderful growth in\nstrength and\npower, and in\nfinancial and industrial opera\ntiens, has startled the world and\nthis was accurately forecast by\nDaniel.\nThe nation seen in the vision!\nwas different from the ethers,\nand Germany surely has been\nvery different, especially in Its\nspirit of militarism and in its al\nmost universal desire te rule the\nworld. While ether nations de\nmanded military strength te\npreserve the balance of power,\nall classes in Germany have\nunited in the uDbuildinsr of a\ngreat military machine that\nshould enable them te overcome\nall oppositions and te aehieve\ntheir ambitious desire and dream\nthat Germany should rule the\nworld. The pregress of the war\nhas revealed a remarkably spon\ntaneous sentiment and belief by\nthe iprivate soldiers, as well as\nthe officers of the German armies,\nincluding the Kaiser himself\nand the civil population, that the\nend of the present war will sub-\nject the world te their power.\nAnd tlen, tee, the German\ntinn is rliff-rent fi-r., tli ntlur\n. H...w.... .- . ... . ..mm vviil.1 I\nnations of the present day by\nthe fact that it is the only great j Daniel\'s statement, in which he\nPower that really wants te as ! says. \',The greatness of the\nsume and exercise the respjnsi- kingdom under the whole heav\nbilities of autocratic power and en shall be given te the people\ndominion ever all people of thejef the saints of the Most High,\nworld. The Germans net only whose kingdom is an everlasting\nwant this power, but have been ; kingdom, and all dominieus\ntaught te believe that it is theirs\nof right by their might, and they\ntberefeie have net hesitated te\nmake war upon the world te sat\nisfy their ambition.\nIn Jehn\'s vis 0:1 of the nation\njust as it plunges into the war.\nhe saw it with \'two horns like a\nlamb." This description accur\nately represents the two great na\ntions, Germany and Austria,\nunited under the leadership and\nauthority of the Kaiser, as the\nbeast in the vision.\nWhile the two horns of the\nlamb represents the two nations,\nthe beast of the vision represents\nthe Kaiser. Jehn plainly says\nthat the beast is a man. Frem\nthe description given by the\ntwo prophets we may well be\nlieve that both of them saw the\nKaiser pictured as clearly as\nthough thrown en the screen by\nour present day films, showing\nhim in his miliary uniform and\ngiving an accurate likeness of\nhim. Fer Jehn says. "He spake\nas a dragon.\' and Daniel says his\n\'leek was mers stout than his\nfellows," and he had "a mouth\nthat spake rery great things."\nIn both speech and appearance\nthe Kaiser fits the visions of the\nprophets. Egotism, boldness,\nhaughtiness characterizes his\nlanguage and appearance te an\nextent Ithat is net found in the\nworld\'s list of great rulers.\nNever until the war did any\nman make tire come down frem\nthe heavens. Jehn says, \'\'He\nmaketh fire come dowe from\nheaven," and this atest startling\nprophetic statement bas been\nverified before the world in our\ntime by the dropping of fire\nBelgium. He was a man 666\nmonths old when seen by the\nprophets. This evidence is con\nelusive. The proof is apparently\ncomplete that tbe German Kai\nser is the beast of the prophetical\nvisions. Very closely does he\nand his nation meet all th re\nquirements of the visions of both\nof the prophets, Daniel and Jehn.\nWe may be sure that this beast\ndoes net represent any ruler of\npast history. And it is difficult\nte conceive that the future will\npresent conditions and rulers will\nse nearly approach the picture in\nthe visions as the world is new\nwitnessing\nThe forty-two months foretold\nby Daniel will be completed with\nthe menth of January, 1918.\nThen, the prophet says, "the\njudgment shall sit, and they\nshall take away his dominion te\nconsume and destroy it unto the\nend." At the present time we\nde net knew who will sit in the\njudgment en the Kaiser, with\npower te dethrone. It will be\nthe verdict of a council consti\ntuted by representatives of the\nallied nations, after their armies\nhave wen victory ever the Ger\nman hosts. Or possibly the Ger\nman people will themselves re\nmove Kaiser front the throne and\ninaugurate government by the\npeople. The ending ef the forty\ntwo months in January, 1918. is\nbased upon tbe belief t hat they\nbegin with the commencement\nof the war, July, I9I4.\nWhen tbe Kaiser bas been de\nthroned, the prepbet says, "the\nkingdom and dominion, (and the\ngreatness of the kingdom under\nthe whole heaven, shell be given\nte the PEOPLE of the saints of\nthe Most High."\nDaniel saw the monarchies\n"break in pieces. And became\nlike the chaff of the summer\nthreshing floors, and the wind\ncarried them away."\nAll signs point te tbe fulfill\nment of this part of Daniel\'s\nprophecy within a few months.\nAnd se, with tbe ending of the\nKaiser\'s reign, tbe paeple of\nGermany will will assume cba-\nna-,tre! of ttteir Government We\nUf exnect this result as sure\n\'\nNetice the completeness of\nshall serve and obey him."\nThe whfcle earth h the extent\nof the kingdom which is te be\ngoverned by the people of the\nChristain nations.\nDe net imagine that the above\nstatements of the the prophets\nhave been gathered from scat\ntered portions of the Scriptures,\nand se given a false meaning by\ncombining them. All of the\nforegoing is based en Daniel\'s\nvision as recorded continuously in\nthe seventh chapter of the Boek\nDaniel, and Jehn\'s vision as re\ncorded in verses 11 te 18 of the\nthirteenth chapter of Revelations.\nThat we are new living in most\nmomeuteus times is absolutely\ncertain. Stupendous events are\nof most daily occurrence. Made\nsick and tired unto death by the\nmost horrible war in the earth\'s\nhistory, and most frightfully\npunished by the cruel power of\nthe beast for forty-two months,\nthe people of all earth will unite\nin demanding the bringing about\nthe disarmament of the nations,\naud militarism will finally be\ncrushed. Nations will observe\nthe Gelden Rule in dealing with\neach ether, thus avoiding disputes\nand promoting peace and har\nmony and insuring happiness\nthroughout the earth. Thus will\n1 Peace ea earth, geed will te\nmen\'\' at last prevail, the new dis\npensation of time being for the\nperfecting ef the saints.\nATARRH CANNOT\nCURED\nBE\nwith Lecal Applications, as they\ncannot reach the seat of the di\nsease.
