ÍJAILHOAP-S.-O-\nThe Santa Fc New Mexican of\nThursday contains the following\nself-explanatory article concern\ning valuable work recently done\nby lion. W. K. Martin, the popular\nand efficient clerk of this judicial\ndistrict:\n"William F,. Martin, of Socor\nro, the ctlicient and courteous\nclerk of the Fifth Judicial Dis\ntrict Court, has been in the capital\nfor two days attending to oflieial\nbusiness and settling up some\nprivate alTairs. Since his appoint\nment by Judge l\'ope, a few\nmonths ago, he has been very\nbusy, as the judge has been hold\ning court incessantly in the coun\nties of his district, has nearly\ncleared the dockets and done a\ntremendous amount of work.\n"Although extremely occupied\nduring that time, Mr. Martin\nstudied the necessities of the\nhookeeping of his office and found\ntune to think out and prepara a\nnew and modern system of book\nkeeping in the district and espe\ncially in cash accounts. This he\nhas arranged to introduce at once.\nThe fees and other public monies\nreceived by him in his oflieial\ncapacity are not deposited to his\nprivate credit, but are deposited\nto the credit of. . h. Martin,\nDistrict Court clerk, in each of\nthe counties where collected. In\nSocorro, this account is kept with\nPrice Brothers, bankers: in\nLincoln, with Jaffa Brothers;\nin Koswell, with the First Nation\nal Bank; in Carlsbad also with\nthe First National Bank, and in\nPortales with the First National\nBank. Within ten days after\neach term of court held in any of\nthe counties, all fines collected\nwithin that term are turned over\nto the respective county treasurer\nas required by law. No checks\nare drawn against these accounts\nexcepting for transmittal of fees\nto the territorial treasury, to re\nfund fees to litigants, or to settle\nwith county treasurers for\namounts of lines collected. In\neach county, a separate cash book\nis kept for that purpose, lie has\nalso established in his ofiice a\nuniform system of books and\nblanks, which by Traveling\nAuditor SatTord and other experts\nwho have examined it, has been\ndeclared first class, up-to-date\nand calculated in every way to\nsave expense, time and work, as\nwell as to insure correctness and\na record of all proper and neces\nsary data in criminal and civil\ncases. Mr. Martin is known asa\nline penman, accountant and\nbookkeeper, has had much\nexperience in tnat une ana lias\nbrought it into use in his new\nofiice.

Some of the\ninhabitants of the city are look\ning forward to the time when\nthey will have to rely solely upon\nbeer for drinking purposes. In\nfact, a few seem to have put !\nthemselves into training for that\ncalamitous event.\nA LiTTI.iv incident which oc\ncured in the recent sale by Terri\ntorial Treasurer J. II. Vaughn of\nNew Mexico refunding bonds,\namounting toilOl.OOO.OO bearing\n4 percent at par and accrued inter\nest, shows how high the credit of\nthis Territory under the present\nRepublican administration stands,\nand how financiers view Terri\ntorial securities, even those bear\nring a low rate of interest. N.\nW. Harrison Co., the Chicago\nbankers, who purchased these\nImnds, made the following remark\nin the letter written by them in\nreply to the dispatch sent by\nTreasurer Vaughn that they had\nbeen awarded the bonds: "We\nthink very highly of your Terri\ntorial bonds and always like to\nhave some of them on hand."\nComment is not necessary.\nSanta Fc New Mexican.\n.Not a Short War.\nNo one is looking for an early\nclose of the war between Japan\nand Kussia. It may last two years,\nor some decisive victory on land\nor sea may bring it to an end\nsooner. Although there has been\nconsiderable gossipin the foreign\ndespatches about the possible\nintervention of King I\'M ward and\nothers on behalf of peace, few\nwell-informed persons expect\nintervention unless China should\nb\' drawn into the conflict.\nKussia has been moving slowly,\nfeeling confident that the\nJapanese advance on land can be\ndelayed till sufficient Russian\ntroops have been assembled in\nManchuria todefeat the invading\narmy in a pitched battle. What\npurport to be the Kussian plans\nhave been disclosed in an inter\nview with a Moscow friend of\nGeneral Kuropatkin, published in\nTaris. The correspondent who\nobtained the interview declares\nthat it contains the views of the\ncommanding general, Whether\nthis be correct or not, it contains\nmatter of sufficient interest to\nreceive attention.\nGeneral Kuropatkin\'s friend is\nmade to say that the general does\nnot expect the Kussian naval\npower in the Kast to be effective\ntill September or October. The\nsquadron that is getting ready at\nCronstadt in the Baltic cannot be\ngot to sea till the latter part of\nAugust. At that time it will\nstart for the Yellow Sea, convoy\ning coal ships, and will be joined\nby the squadron cruising in the\nKed Sea. When the combined\nsquadrons reach the Kast they\nwill relieve the blockade of Port\nArthur and attempt to destroy\nJapanese war-ships as well as the\ntransports, which by that time\nGeneral Kuropatkin is said to be\nlieve will be carrying the defeated\nJapanese soldiers from Korea and\nManchuria back to Japan. When\nthe Japanese have been driven\nfrom the mainland and from the\nsea the Russians will invade\nJapan.\n"It is a Tokyo, and nowhere\nelse, "General Kuropatkin ismade\nto say, "that we shall sign condi\ntions of peace."\nJapan\'s hope of victory lies in\nits ability to force matters to a\ndecisive issue before Kussia can\nget its army and navy across or\naround two continents into the\nfield of action.

If\nthey arc full he expresses disap\npointment at having to take one\na few feet away and if there are\nany women in the party they are\npositively uneasy and feel them\nselves defrauded if they don\'t get\nthat location. Nine times out of\nten he will telephone to have a\nplace by a window on that side\nsaved for him.\n"The fuñny part of it is," con\ntinued the observer, "that after\nit is secured no one in the party\never glances at the water, but all\ngo on with their talking and\neating apparently as oblivious of\nthe lake\'s existence, much more\nso than if they sat on the other\nside of the room. This, and the\nfact that the same people go back\nand forth on Michigan avenue\nand ride in the Illinois Central\ntrains without speaking of Lake\nMichigan or giving it a glance,\nmake it appear that this request\nwhich thcChicagoman invariably\nmakes is a habit rather than\nsomething that adds to his enjoy\nment of his dinner."\nSpanish Children.\nWith the exception of the\nJapanese the Spanish children\nare perhaps the most polite in\nthe world. Their training in\nthis respect is exquisite.\nThe education of the pirls in\nthe\'littleelegancies of life iseven\nmore careful than that of the\nsmall boys. The well bred Nina,\nthough her summers may be\ncounted on one hand, asks in the\nmorning after your health and\nexpresses her gratification on\nlearning that you have enjoyed\ngood rest. If you admire the\nrosebud in her hair she promptly\nanswers, "It is at your disposal,"\nand slips it into your belt. If you\nboth are thirsty and there is but\none glass of aniseed water she\ninsists that you shall drink it.\nIf there is a doorway tobe passed\nno extremity of excitmen tor sleepy\neyed weariness can induce her to\nenter before you. If you offer\nher a choice in presents she will\nonly say, "What you are most\npleased to give me will be what I\nshall like best."\nHer games, too, are full of\ncoquetry and courtesy. Exchange.\nA Sure Thing.\nIt is said that nothing is sure\nexcept death and taxes, but that\nis not althogether true. Dr.\nKing\'s New Discovery for\nconsumption is a sure cure for all\nlung and throat troubles. Thous\nands can testify to that. Mrs. C.\nB. Van Metre of Shepherdtown,\nW. Va says "I had a severe case\nof bronchitis and for a year tried\neverything I heard of, but got no\nrelief. One bottle of Dr. King\'s\nNew Discovery then cured me\nabsolutely."

U\nROMANCE IN NEW\nMEXICO HISTORY\nHi Court of rrlvnt Ijiml Claims In Um\nRecord. ReTCst Many Interesting\nFacts.\nAn interesting feature of the\nbusiness of the court of private\nland claimsis the historic romance\nattaching to the settlement and\nholding of the land grants, says\nJudge Wilbur F. Stone in a recent\narticle.\nThe documentary evidence in\nmany cases had to be supplement\ned by the oral testimony of\nwitnesses, relating to occupation,\nabandonment by Indian hostili\nties, hereditary, and family\npedigree of claimants, dating\nback to a time when witnesses\nfrom seventy-five to one hundred\nTears old testified to what.\nwhen children, they heard told\nby their aged grandfathers. Here\nwere brought out the stories of\nthe marches northward into the\nfrontier piovinces across arid\ndeserts, over drifted sands,\nthrough prickly cactus, thorny\nmezquite chaparal, and under\nburning suns reflecting the blind\ning light from wastes of snow\nwhite alkali, on and on to the\nwelcome pincelad mountains with\ntheir cool streams and fertile\nvalleys. Then the settlements,\nthe building of the rude adobe\nand jacal dwellings the little\nmission church with its venerated\ncross, the forts for defense, the\npastoral life with flocks of sheep\nand cattle, and the oft contention\nover watering places the life\nover again of the patriarchal age\nof Abraham and Lot. Then the\nhostile raids of the Indians, the\nmassacres, captivities, fights,\nyears of wars and persistent\nreturns.\nIn these stories one could look\nback in fancy over the long trails\nthese settlers followed and see the\nmarches of the first Spanish\ninvaders, the old Conquistadores,\nwho, like the crusaders of the\nmiddle ages, clad in all the\npanoply of Spanish cavaliers,\nresplendent in the glamor of the\nconquest of a new world, rode\nforth from the "halls of the\nMontezumas" on that long stretch\nof mountain plateau from the City\nof Mexico to El Paso del Norte,\nand thence up the Rio Grande to\nits mountain sources a journey\nof nearly 2,000 miles bearing the\nflag of Spain and the banner of\nthe cross, the mailed warriors\ngoing before and black-robed\npriests following behind, and\nwith glittering pomp and holy\nzeal bayoneting, baptizing and\nbenevolently assimilating the\nnatives, "de las Indias."\nThe old world has scoffed at\nthe lack of interesting history in\nAmerica. The history of the\nAtlantic colonies and Mississippi\nstates has been immortalized by\nthe novelists and poets, like\nCooper, and Campbell, in tragic\nand bloody song and story, but\nthe greater romance in the drama\nof Amnrican history, touched\nupon by the pens of Prescot and\nthe Spanish chronicles, is spread\nover the sun lands of the trans\nMissouri and Pacific half of the\ncontinent, now the graveyard of\nthe mystic Toltec, the golden\ntempled Aztec, the peaceful Pue\nblos, and the fierce Apaches the\nBedouins of the American desert.\nAnd now the societies are\nresurrecting the history of the\nCliff Dwellers, rivaling in inter\nest and antiquity that of the\npeoples of the Nile and the\nGanges.\nMr. Joseph Pominville, of Still\nwater, Minn., after having spent\nover $2,000 with the best doctors\nfor stomach trouble, without\nrelief, was advised by his drug\ngist, Mr. Alex. Richard, to try a\nbox of Chamberlain\'s Stomach\nand Liver Tablets. He did so,\nand is a well man today. If\ntroubled with indigestion, bad\ntaste in the mouth, lack of ap\npetite or constipation, give these\nTablets a trial, and you are\ncertain to be more than pleased\nwith the result.

An\' ef yo\' had a hund\'ed\nwatermellions would yo\' gib me\nfifty?"\n"No, Ah wouldn\'t gib yo\' no\nfifty watermellions."\n"Would yo\' gib me twenty\nfive?" "No, Ah wouldn\'t gib yo\' no\ntwenty-five."\n"Seems ter me yous powahful\nstingy, Mose.
