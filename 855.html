Volstead, chairman of the\nJudiciary Committee of the House.\nThe bill, which has already passed\nthe Senate, ciang s the law by mak\ning it possible to remove withu,.t a\nhearing, as at present, persons indict\ned in one place from any place where\nthey happen to be arrested. The Civ\nil Liberties Union and other interested\norganizations charge that the bill is\nan "attempt to railroad defendants\nwitho\'ut a chance to be heard." Mr.\nDeSilver in his letter says:,\n"Under the existing law, which Sen\nator Nelson\'s bill-would repeal when\na person indicted for example, in Cal\nifornia, is found in Maine, there is no\ndifficulty about having him arrested.\nHe may, however, though indicted, be\ninnocent. The law takes account of\nthe possible hardship of whisking an\ninnocent man away from his home\nend friends and attorneys and bonds\nmen to defend himself against a\ncharge of crime in a remote part of\nthe country where it is not unlikely\nthat he is not only without friends or\ncounsel, but also a subject of hostile\nfeeling. He cannot be removed with\nout proof that an offense was com\nmitted and that there are good\ngrcunds for believing him guilty. He\ncan, before removal, test the validity\nof the law and of the indictment, or\nprove in cases of mistake that he is\nrot in fact the person wanted. He\nmay also have bail fixed in a com\nmunity where he is known.\n"Senator Nelson\'s bill would do\naway with all tiis consideration for\npossible arni, iip fact under our tradi-,,\ntions, presumed innocence. I pro\nvkes that, a person indicted Imder a\nfederal statute may be sumnunrily\nseized wherever he may live or be and\nremoved without hearing,.to the place\nof indictment, no matter-how remote.\nIf, ;after what: lapse of time, it turns\n,out that his ar:,.4t was a mistake, he\nwill be given big ihleage home and a\nmnintenance aowvand e not exceeding\nW0 , nday as ccmpensation."\nThe bill is being opposed by repre\nsentorvk of ihe ." ericaa .Feera.\ntloii of Labor as * \'it-egliz.*... \' oIj\nditval kidapping." it wa ect ko\nwhat ithert are bebdid Jhe bill. but\nin isdra\'ais wn wa lod be -ost like\n\'. :: tar c es, e si\nMILL, AND 2 ELEVATORS\nDESTROYED AT SIDNEY\nOne of the most destructive confla\ngrations in Sidney and in eastern\nMontana occurred a week ago Thurs\nday when the Russell Miller Milling\nCompany\'s mill and two elevators\nwere totally destrqyed by fire.\nThe fire was first discovered short\nly after eight o\'clock in the top of\nthe middle elevator, and while the\nfire department responded promptly\nand every effort on the part of the\nmill employees with their fire appar\natus was used, all efforts were futile\nand the loss will \'amount to close to\n$150,000. The Sidney fire department\nwas handieapped as the water mains\nwere not close enough so that their\nhose would reach the scene and they\nwere helpless.\nWhen it was discovered that all ef\nforts to save the mill and elevator\nwas useless, attention was given to\nneair-by buildings and at one time the\nFarmers elevator, located across the\ntrack from the mill and bout 150 feet\naway, caught on fire from the sparks\nof the fire, and due to the efforts of\nElgin Cafere\nA good clean place toýEat.\nWe want your businfl\ntry to please Everyone\nserve only the best of\nables all the time.\nNext Door to Leland\nPopesku Bros., Proprieto.\nn.t •wood - MOIo\nV.
