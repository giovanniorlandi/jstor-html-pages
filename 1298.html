At\nthis meeting it seemed to be the\nopinion that some of the lodges of\nthe town could best accomplish the\ndesired results, so a committee of\nfive was appointed to confer with\nthe W. O. W. and M. W. A. to\nascertain if they would undertake\nto give a "log rolling." The com\nmittee consisted of Fen Batty,\nchairmau, B. C. Wiltse, Fred Mc\nKenzie, Wesley Hockersmith and\nW. F. Schmadeka.\nThe W. O. W. at their meeting\nMonday night decided not to make\nthe undertaking. But the M. W.\nA. has called a special meeting for\nnext Wednesday night to make ar\nrangements for a "log rolling" on\nOctober 2nd and 3rd.\nMost of the business men of the\ntown are heartily in favor of some\nkind of a carnival, and, as a "log\nrolling" given by a lodge will not\nentail so much expense as a general\nfair and is not so great an under\ntaking to carry to success, it will\nbe endorsed by all and there is no\nquestion as to the grand success of\nthis undertaking.\nA\nca.\nOUT FROM FLORENCE.\nS. A. Moon Thinks That Camp\nHas Good Future.\nS. A. Moon came out from\nFlorence last Tuesday to remain\ntill after the county convention at\nCottonwood. I 11 speaking of the\nnew gold strikes at- Florence, Mr.\nMoon stated that the H. K. Moore\nstrike was unquestionably a very\nrich strike aud that the reports\npublished about it are not exagger\nated. This discovery was made on\nthe old Martha Washington prop\nerty, from which a great deal of\ngold was taken in the early days.\nIt is estimated that about $100,000,\n000 has been taken out of the\nFlorence mining district. Mr.\nMoore has struck a 4-foot ledge,\nwith a one foot pay streak that can\nhardly he excelled.\nMr. Moon thinks that Florence\nwill be one of the greatest mining\ncamps in the W\'est when the right\nkind of work is started. There\nhas been too many fake propo\nsitions carried on for the real good\nof the camp. On the surface there\nis a good supply of oxidized free\nmilling ore, hut the real values\nwill be taken out when great\ndepths and the sulphite ores are\nreached.\nMr. Hart, a mining man from\nCripple Creek, Colo., is now in the\nFlorence district making investi\ngations for Colorado capitalists,\nwho are becoming very much in\nterested in the prospects of that\nsection. Mr. Moon is now engaged\nin doing development work on his\nplacer mines.\nBACK FROM MINES.\nWill Furnish Electric Powerfor\nOperation.\nGeo. K. Reed and party returned\nfrom their visit to the mines iu\nBuffalo Hump aud Elk City min\ning districts last Friday. Engi\nneers E. P Coles and E. M. Sco\nfield, of the Scofield company,\nwhich has the contract for the con\nstruction of the electric railroad\nfrom Lewiston to this place, were\nmembers of the party and made\nthis trip to ascertain the feasibility\nof furnishing electric power for the\noperation of the mines.\nIn speaking of the proposition,\nMr. Scofield said that the mines\nwere badly in need of the power\nand that to furnish it was perfectly\nfeasible. The only thing to be\nconsidered now is the cost and\nroute of construction, which is now\nbeing taken up by the engineers of\nhis company.\nMost of the party left Friday\nevening for Lewiston. With suf\nficient power to successfully operate\nall these mines and Orangeville\nthe railroad terminus we would\nsurely enjoy prosperity in this\nvicinity.\n. .. „ , ,\nAnother New Brick.\nA. F. Parker informs us that\nMajor O. A. Williams, who Bpent a\nfew days in this city last week\nwhile on his way home from the\nstate convention at, Couer d\'Alene,\nwill soon erect a two story brick\nbuilding on the corner of Main and\nMeadow streets. The building is\nto be 168 by 80 feet and will cost\nabout $14,000. There will be two\nstore rooms on the lower floor and\noffices up stairs. These offices will\nbe fitted up with all modern con\nveniencee and the store room\nwill be the roost commodious in\nthe city.\nI\n;\nof\nRAILROAD WORK\nCOMMENCED\ning\nthe\nby\na\nA Big Crew of Hen With Over Twenty\nTeams Mow at Work.\nMEN ARRIVED HERE LAST TUESDAY\nMany Farm Teams Will be Em\nployed After Harvest.\nRailroad work has at last been\nactually begun on the Orangeville\nend of the Northern Pacific\'s new\nline that is to tap one of the rich\nest agricultural and most promis\ning raining districts of the state.\nOptimistic and pessimistic views\nhave been exchanged and inter\nchanged for months and for years\non the subject of a railroad to\nCamas Prairie,\ngrown old hoping to see a railroad\ninto Orangeville, but they have\npassed away without realizing\nthis, their earnest desire,\nnow these hopes have taken a form\nof materialization in the way of\nconstruction work on the road\nright here, where we can see it,\nand that certainly is encouraging.\nLast Tuesday evening, E. Enner\nson, who was here last week mak\ning arrangements, arrived in this\ncity with a crew of graders and\nabout twenty teams. They brought\nwith them four big wagon loads of\ntools and camping outfits, besides\nquite a number of big wheel grad\ners and scrapers.\nThe crew was brought into town\nTuesday night, but returned Wed\nnesday to erect their camp house,\nthe lumber for which is already on\nthe ground. The cross-sectioning\nat this end is already completed\nand as soou as the crew are located\nin their new quarters the work of\ngrading will be started. Mr. Enu\nerson says that work will perhaps\nbe slow for the first few weeks but\nas soon as harvesting is over they\nexpect to be able to hire more\nteams and men will be more plenti\nA crew of twenty-five men have\nbegun work on the grading just\nibis side of Cottonwood.\nin\n20\na\nPeople have\nBut\nat\non\nof\nare\nthe\nin\nhis\nfill.\nRETURNED FROM DIXIE.\nMuch Activity In Mines in That\nDistrict.\nThe party consisting of J.

Eakin and daugh\nter, Bessie, and Roy Smith came\nout with Mr. Overman\'s party.\nMr. Eakin and Mr. Smith will\nreturn in a few days taking with\nthem their winter supplies on\npack-horses. Miss Bessie will re\nmain with her sister, Mrs. Over\nman, and attend school this winter.\nThe party was quite successful in\ntheir fishing expedition. During\nthe entire trip they caught 957\ntrout. To Mrs. Overman perhaps\nbelong the honors in fishing, her\nnumber being 100 fish in one day.\nIt is not stated whether or not it\nwas an eight or ten hour day, but\nit is a fact they didn\'t weigh over\n30 pounds.\nMr. Overman reports some ac\ntivity in mining in the Dixie coun\ntry. A Portland company is put\nting iu a reservoir and quite a lot\nof improved machinery on the old\nBlaine & Cummings placer proper\nty. At the old Comstock, a steam\npower plant is being installed to\ntake the place of the water power.\nThe Ramey Ridge mining dis\ntrict is the scene of much activity.\nA uew wagon road is being built\nfrom Fryer\'s place to join the War\nren road at Werdenhoff.

MuBROOM,\nOFFICIAL COUNTY PAPER\nThursday, Am. 23.\n1906\nFARMERS AND THE TARIFF.\nThe furmers can hardly approve\nthe republican standpat program,\nwhen they find the price of wheat,\noats, corn and cotton declining\nand the price of all they buy rapid\nly advancing. Where does the\nboasted protection to agriculture\ncome in under the present protec\ntive tarifT and how arc farmers pro\ntected, although the tariff law pro\nvides that 26 cents a bushel on\nwheat and 16 cents a bushel on\noats he collected on imports? The\nprice of wheat is now lower than it\nlias been for ten years or since\nthe present tariff law was enacted\nin August, 1897.\nThose farmers, who are repub\nlicans, should demand of their\n"standpat" leaders a fair deal, and\nif the agricultural machinery trust,\nthe barbed wire combine, the\nlumber association and the clothing\ntrusts, are to still he protected by\nthe tariff in charging exhorbitant\nprices for their products, that\nsome method of raising the price of\ncereals and keeping them stable\nshould offset trust high prices.\nThe fact is, however, that no\ntariff can protect the farmer on his\nproducts, of which the surplus must\nbe sold abroad as the price paid by\nthe foreigners for that surplus\nfixes the price here. The only\nrelief that the farmer can receive\nis to he able to buy in the chea pest\nmarket and this he can never do as\nlong as the trusts, that controll all\nhe buys, are protected by the tai iff\nfrom competition. It is plain\ntherefore that the farmer who votes\nfor a republican congressman, is\nvoting to\'contiuue \'the protection\nto the trusts and for higher prices,\nwith no protection to help the\nprice of his owu products.\n/\nof\nThe "eight hour" day witli\nwhich the administration is trying\nto head off the labor revolt, looks\nrather slim when confronted hy the\nproposition of,the French socialists.\nM.

The railroad\nright-of-way is now all bought and\npaid for, and the road will be\nstructed thereon.\njust where to expend our money in\n(lermaneut improvement of the\npublic highways leading into the\ncity. The roads north and west\nrequire immediate attention as\nsoon as the fall rains set in. The\nuse of a "split log road drag"\nafter every rain will provide good\nhighways which will do more to\npromote local trade than anything | <>n\nelse ever suggested. It will also i\ngive the farmers of the country dis- j\ntricts an object lesson whicb\'tliey j\nwill tie quick to follow when they i\nsee how easily the roads can be im-1\nproved at small expense by the use\nof simple apppliauces. The new j\nroad recently opened in the west j\nof town shows wiiai can lie done\nin that direction.\nThe most potent factor iu the j on\ncounty seat election which result\ned in transferring the county seat ;\nfrom Mt. Idaho to Grangeville\nthe horrible condition of the road\nbetween the two towns. Now it !\nis absolutely sure that unless the\nroad through the Pearson and i\nYates lanes west of tow n, are not\nspeedily improved, the growth of\nGrangeville will be materially we\naffected detrimentally. The far\nmere west and north will not haul we\nUMlr grain here over bad roads and\nbetter roa(l8 exist to tl,e west\n•f»«n. They will haul their box\nM**» to the new town, or else to I The\ncon\nWe now know\nw as\nI such station» a» may be established\nbetween here and the new town.\n! A similar condition exists to the\nnorth. We must improve the roads\nleading into this town, or G ange\nville will be up against it. Let the\nCommercial Club spend its surplus\nin road improvements during the\n\'coming fall and spring, and by the\ntime the railroad is in operation\nwe shall then be in shape to reap\nthe benefit by having the farmers\nbring their grain here for ship\nment, and thereby get the benefit\nof their local trading. This matter\nof good roads is of far-reaching\nimportance to £>raugeville, and it\nshould lake precedence over every\nthing else if we are to maintain our\nsupremacy as the commercial cen\nter of Camas Prairie.\nThe citizens of Orangeville\ncould not spend a few dollars to\nbetter advantage than in having\nsome of these "split log road drags"\nmade and giving one to each of the\nsupervisors in all the tributary\nroad districts, with instructions\nhow and when to use it. They are\nonly useful when used after a good\nrainfall.

One sat by a stream and\ndlpinsl her hand Into the water and\nheld It up, another plucked atrawber\nries until the ends of her fingers were !\npink and another gathered violets until\nher hand« were fragrant. An old. hag\ngard woman, passing by, asked, "Whc\nwill give me a gift, for I am poor?" All\nthree denied her, but another who sat\nnear, uuwashêd In the stream, un\ntained with fruit unadorned with\nflowers, gave her a little g ft and satis\nfled the poor woman, and then she ask\ned them what was the dispute, and\nthey told her and lifted up before her\ntbelr beautiful bands. "Beautiful In\ndeed," said she when she saw them,\nbut when they asked her which was the\nmost beautiful she said, "It Is not the\nhand which Is washed clean In the\nbrook. It Is not the hand that Is tipped\nwith red. It Is not the hand that is gar\nlanded with fragrant flowers, but the\nhand that gives to the poor Is the most\nbeautiful." As she said these words\nher wrinkles fled, her staff was thrown\naway and she stood before them nu\nangel from heaven, with authority to\ndeclde the question tn dispute, and that\ndecision has stood the test of all time.\nHull Mm4 the Trat ml\nAll Tiaaae.\nA Drtlak\nSTATE LOTTERIES.\nthey Wer* Oim Very Com non and\nVery Popular la Barope.\nLotteries were common in ancient\nRoute, aud during the middle ages lot\nteries were utilised by the Italian mer\nchants for the disposal of their goods.\nSome of the Italian atates then adopted\nthe lottery sa a means of raising reve\nnue, and the institution of state lot\nteries afterward became very com\nmon and very popular throughout Eu\nrope.\nThe earliest English state lottery of\nwhich there is any record was lu 150!*,\nwhen 40,000 chances were sold at 10\nshillings each, the drawing taking\nplace ln the west door of St. Paul\'s\ncathedral.\nThe prises consisted of articles of\nplate, and the profits were employed\nfor the repair of certain harbors. Early\nln tbe reign of Queen Anne private lot\nteries were suppressed "as public nui\nsances," but government lotteries, how\never, were still maintained, and from\n1709 to 1824 considerable sums were\nannually raised hi lotteries authorized\nby acts of parliament.\nThe average yearly profit to the gov\nernment from 1793 to 1824 was over\n£340,900. On the ground of Injury to\npublic morals lotteries of all kinds\nwere abolished ln Engluud in 1820.—\nLondon Saturday Review.\nFORGET YOURSELF.\n8* One Cm» Grow While HU\nThongrhta Are Self Centered.\nForget yourself. You will never do\nanything greut until you do. Self con\naclousness is a disease with many.\nNo matter what they do, they can nev\ner get away from themselves. They\nbecome warped upon the subject of\nself analysis, wondering how they\nlook, how they appear, what others\nwill think of them aud how they can\nenhance tbelr own Interests. In other\nwords, every thought and every effort\nseems to focus upon self; nothing radi\n• ates from them.\nNo one can grow while his thoughts\nare self centered. The sympathies of\nthe man who thinks only of himself\nare soon dried up. Self consciousness\nacts us a paralysis to all expansion\nstrangles enlargement, kills aspiration,\ncripples executive ability. The mind\nwhich accomplishes things looks out,\nnot ln; It la focused upon Its object,\nnot upon ftaelf.\nTbe Immortal acts have been uncon\nsciously performed. The greatest pray\ners have been tbe silent longings, the\n•ccret yearnings of the heart, not those\nwhich have been delivered facing a\ncritical audience. The dally desire Is\ntbe perpetual prayer, the prayer that\nIs heard and answered.—Success.\nWkat the Blind See.\n"I can always tell when people are\nlooking at me," said a blind man. "In\ndeed, nearly all blind persons can tell\nwhen people are looking at them.

When those I\ndislike are about the glow la darkened\nand besmirched. I can tell what kind\nof characters people have by tbe touch\nof their hands. There Is individuality\nIn the touch.
