Epes "Randolph gives out, the following information concern, ing the King:, \'"I am sorry to find among the, people of Yuma so entire a mis, apprehension of the relations which, exist between S. Morgan Smith, and the King cf Arizona company., Mr. Smith, as a matter of fact, as, we claim, has entirely tailed in, many important particulars to, comply with the contract made, with our company by himself and, Blaisdell. At no time, however,, has it been our purpose or desire to, restrict the contractors to their, legal rights onlj I am amazed, that Mr. Smith should raakfl and, awear to the statements which are, contained in his complaint whieh, hasbeen filed at Yuma. Mr. Smith,, (or his agents) has" disseminated, copies of thin complaint broadcast, throughout the c untry and he, seeks to convey the impression, that we are attempting to deprive, him, by fraudulent methods, of all, compensation for the money and, time spent by him and his partner., As a matter of fact, we made every, honest endeavor to adjust matters, with Mr. Smith amicably. We, offered him all of the money which, his books show that he has spent,, with twenty-five per cent profit, upon such sum and an additional, one thousand dollars \'a month for, his own services from the date of, the execution of the contract to the, time of the offer. This offer was, made to him in Los Angeles about, thirty days ago, in the Hollenbeck, hotel, in the presence of his son and, counsel and H. B. Gleason, former, ly of Yuma. When he declined, this effer, we offered to give him, stock in the company in return for, ail of the money which his books, show that he invested, at-the same, price that we paid the original, prospectors for the stock nearl)\', three years ago, without allowing, ourselves interest upon the money, which was then paid. This offer, he likewise declined., "We regret the inevitable litiga, tion; but feel that we havs honor, ably exhausted every effort to effeet, a fair settlement, and if Mr. Smith, should find himself at law entitled, to less than we have offered him,, he can blame nothing but his own, cupidity.", OOEBEL ASSASSIXA.TED!, Goebel has been assassinated!, The shots which will cost the gal, lant Goebel his life were fired at, fifteen minutes past eleven yester, day morning in front of the capi, tol building at Frankfort, Ken, tucky, while on his way to attend, the session of the legislature.

A large and appre, ciative audience assembled at Elks, Hall and each number of the well-, prepared program received a liberal, share of applause. The program was, well rendered, there being no tedious, delays in the same, as every member, responded promptly. The musical, portion oi tue program was par-ex, cellent., Ihe entertainment commenced at, 8 o\'clock and the first number on the, program was a piano duet which was, admirably rendered by Mrs. Henry, Reese and Miss Lila Godfrey., Then followed a recitation entitled, "Kate Shelley," which was rendered, by Miss Carrie Connor.

Jose was sent up from Cochise, county in 1896 to serve ten years for, murderous assault. It appears that, during a revel somewhere down in, Cochise county Joe and another man, had trouble and the latter was almost, killed during the melee. Joe silently, slid out for Mexico and in the course, of time a friend was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to ten years, at Yuma. The guilty party was safe, in Mexico, no one even suspecting, Joe. However, ho heard of his friend\'s, conviction and he left his safe retreat, to hurry back to the United States, where he gave himself up, told his, story, plead guilty and took tho ten, years from his friend., Joe is an excellent man and his in, carceration has not hardened his, character.

It is the, Foathwcst division of the Territory, and, one of the four original counties of the Ter, ritory, ilany great reclamation projects are, however on foot, and in a few years ex, pect to tee Yama Conr.ty rated as the, 4 j! best in the Territory., The first glimpse the traveler from Cali, fornia catches cf Arizona is that of tlx, picturesque town of Yuma, which is smtgl, situated in the embrace of gentle rollin., hills, upon whose crests and sides th., modern homes of our superior civiliratioi, are crowding the adobe dwellings into, eternal oblivion. Yuma is the gateway v, Arizona, the new empire of the West, upon, whose undeveloped riches the eyes of the, country are at present turned, and as such,, it is hcundto grow and prosper with a, rapidity that at present can hardly be re, alized. But coupled with her geograp)", cal position we find that she is the center, of a country whose agricultural possibili, ties are practically unlimited, being snr-, rounded by a soil the fcrliHty of which, exceeds that of the delta of the Nile, and, wanting oily water to become a paradise of, bloom. Billions of gallons of that precious, fluid have annually gone to waste at, Yuma\'s very doors, but already a reaction, is taking place aud many enterprises are, on foot to supply the life-giving waters of, the yellow Colorado to the thirsty earth., RIVERS OF YUMA COUNTY., In regard to climate, healthfulness, fer, tility and productiveness of soil, facilities, for cultivation, irrigation and abndanceof, water supply, variety of resources and, cheap transportation by rail and by water,, no part of Arizon can surpass Yuma, county, which is destined to become one of, richest and most prosperous comities in, Arisona. - -, It lies between 32 00\' aud M 20\' north, Latitude and 113 20\' and 114 40\' west, longitude. It contaius G.4SS.320 acres. It, is about as large as the Slates of Rhode, Island, Connecticut and Delaware com-bi-.ed,, or as large as either New Hampshire,, Vermont or Massachusetts., The w estern boundary of Yuma Counts, is tormed by the Colorado river, which, separates Arizona from California. The, county is bounded on the north by Williams, Fork and the Santa Maria river, vhosc, waters How into the Colorado; on the ast, by the counties of Pima, Maricopa tnd, Yavapai, and on the south by Sonora,, Mexico. Its county scat is the town of, Yuma., The. Colorado river drains the entire ter, ritory ol Arizona, and every drop of water, which falls ou its mountains and plains, nndsitswayto this mighty river. It is, formed by tho union of the Green and, Grand rivers, fed by the streams which, rise in the Rocky Mountains, aud the melt, ing snows cause a greater depth of water, inthis ri-r m summer than m winter, thus, urnishing the most water at the season, when it Is most required for the purposes, of irrigation and agriculture., It will be seen that for the entire distance, along its western boundary, Yuma County, possess the great advantage of cheap, water trausoortation., The Gila river rises m fne western part, of New Mexico and is fed by numerous, streams, among the most prominent of, which arc the San Pedro, Aua Fria, Ilas, siyampaand Salt rivers. It flows west, through Yuma County and empties into the, Colorado at the town of Yuma., Yuma county, traversed by these great, rivers from its northern to its southern,, end from its eastern to its western uouna, aries, possesses a far greater v.-ate.- eupply, than anv other county in the. Territory,, and far more than can be found in all Cali, fornia., This vater is now being diverted from its, natural channels by means of numerous, large irrigating canals, and utilized for the, purpose of reclaiming and irrigating the, immense tracts of lands u Inch lie in this, favored country, and which arc as fertile, as any in the world., The Southern Pacific Railroad crosses the, Colorado river at the town of Yuma and, runs through the county, following the, generol course, and at an average distance, of about four miles south, of the Gila river,, rendering all the amis susceptible of irri, rationand cultivation, can find an easy, ontlrt in this way and can be transported, ib eU the markets and csuters of population, in the East or West. . j, Another competing railroad is projccica, from San Diego, California, to tic town, f Yuma, and thence along the north side, of the Gila river. Thus Yuma County will, cave exceptional railroad advantages., THE CLIMATE OF YUMA., The climate of Yuma tor nine months of, the year has no equal, as we believe, in the, world, and during remaining tbiee, months of the year, comprising June, July,, and August, the heat is cot oppressive, Even though the thermometer in mid-sum-me.r, may ai times rise above 100s, and oc, isvsionall. cvenreacii 110, yet, ov. ing to, the abtcnee cf moibture iu the air, it is not, appwsivc. The atmosphere is pure, light, mad. baimy. When the- incrcurv jr.ark the ,, tufckeei cxtrt ie of heat, a person dcee not !, cLa sxa H, Rivers, and ilany, Offerings of, and, cury is ranging from SO\' to 90. The air is, so dry that perspiration is absorbed as soon, as it reaches the surface of the body, and, at iiq time in the summer does the heat, produce any discomfort., THE VILLAGE OF YUMA., Although the town of Yuma is the second, eldest community in the Tenitory of Ari, zona, it is astonishing how little its rn, ources are known to the world at large, and, jow slightly developed is the natural wealth, f the county. This is owing partly to, Yuma\'s reputation for unbearable heat, and, partly to the fact that, lying next to Cali, fornia, is has been assumed that the county, has been thoroughly prospected for mineral, wealth, and prospectors hare, in the main,, kept the traveled highways in crossing its, Territory. As a matter of fact one suffers,, less from the heat here than in almost all of, tuo settled communities oi tne east, owing, to the dryness of the atmosphere, and there, ib uo healthier climate on Gcd\'s footstool., People labor out of door from the rising, to the setting of the sun, and suffer no in, convenience. There has never been known,, in this section of country, an authentic case, of sunstroke. Our climate, taken in time,, never fails to cure pulmonary complaint of, any description. Disease such as smallp,:x,, cholera, etc . , rarely visit us, and then or.ly, in a very mild form, and arc never faU-i ex, cept through the peiversity of patients., Contrary to the belief of the uninformed,, the dry heat of the summer months i es, pecially conducive to good health and ex, ceptional vigor, acting naturally upon t.c, human system with the same effect as the, artificial result of a Turkish bath purcfy-, ing and renovating it. As a further matter, of fact, this county has never been even, superficially suspected, and it is 011I3 now, that people are beginning to search its hills, with any degree of systematic enthusiasm, for the mineral wealth hidden there. Ow, ing to the falling off in the price of silver,, deposits of gold only are being sopght for;, and the present result is little short of mar, velous. In all sections of the county from, the Sonora lixe to Williams Fork discoveries, arc daily being made, and the greater the, develonmenfc the greater the wealth dis, played. Wherever the prospector plants, his fofc, ledges of gold coufront him or are, brought to light by the investigating strokes, j of his pick., Portions of the eountr\' traversed for, years by commonly traveled trails are devel, oping into rich storehouses of golden wealth., New and rich placers arc constantly being, discovered, and shipments of placer gold, from this roint through Wells Fargo &i, Co.\'s Express, are steadily increasing in, va\'ud. roni a mining standpoint Yuma, County is rapidly leading the Territory, and, yet as far as that industry is concerned,, this section has received !ut little recog, nition. Agriculturally the country is vastly im, proving. Enterprises that have lain dor, mant the last two years, owing to the gen, eral financial depression and consequent, dearth of money for investment puro.s,, are waking up to new life and vigor. Money, is being attracted in this directum, and on, all aid\'- can be distinguished that indefin, able stir which is the piccursor of an indus, trial awakening. Even within these last, two years of financial stringency and de, pression there has been a steady if slow in, crease in agricultural development and, wealth. A greater area of old farms has j, teen put under cultivation, and new lands, have been inclosed and new fields started., A large section of Blaisdell Heights has been, planted to fruit trees; field of cereals and, alfalfa have been added t the cultivated, area on the Colorada river below town; the, lands lying under th Mohawk and Farmer\'s, canals have been made to yield heavy crojis, of every variety of agricultural products, as, in other sections of the Gila valle-, and the, gardens of Yuma have been added to and, beautified in fruits, flowers and shubbor- to, a more than appreciable extent. Altogether, wo may feel proud of our progress during, these la&t months of business depression and, discouragement. It speaks well foi the in, dustry and pluck of our people, and the, showing made constitutes the best evidence, of the merits of our soil and climate and the, richness of our mineral resources. Nature, has done everything for our county, ami all, that is needed is a touch of the wand of cap, ital to have out hills and valleys spring into, an active life of remunerative industry that, will last aud endure forever., Some three years ago, through tne encrgv, cf H. W. Blaisdell, the Yuma Water and, Light Company was incorporated, and by, means of its large pumping plant, at the, foot of J.au street, the town is abundantly, supplied with water at reasonable rates, and, there have grown into existence new and, large gardens and orchards., MINES., There is no section of the United States,, or probably of the earth, more rich in min, eral wealth than the County of Yuma. All, the country north, cast and south cf Yuma, lies iireetly within the main gold belt that, commences in Alaska and ends in Mexico., From the San Bernardino mountains in, California t3 the Sonora boundary line the, mountains and hills are exceptionally rich in, the precious metal, as though demonstrating, extinct oceans. Tub great Colorado desert, was once an inland sea, cat off centuries and, oerbnps ages aco from the main ocean, leav- j, ing its \'Waters to, evaporate in this intense, heat. Throughout all thr country border, ing the dpsert, including this section, rich, \'nines are being constantly discovered, and, ome of 1 eccnt location are already produc, ing immense profits. In the neighborhood, of Yuma, claims exceedingly rich on the, surface are daily being located, and all signs, portend a great mining boom for this county, vhich will culminate as early as the coining, fall in an inroad of much capital. Experts, vc arriving every week and mines are being, bonded at more than heavy prices. It, s-eems wonderful to believe that all this min, eral wealth has been lying at our very doors,, for so many years without a taker, but the, tendency of prospectors is to go a loi.g dis, tance off into strange lands rather than to, seek for mines in a county as old as Yuma, County and so accessible. The greater the, distance, the hardship, and the danger, the, greater the fascination for the prospector., Distance seems, indeed, to lend enchant, ment to tins view., So it is that this count; is almost a virgin, field for the mine hunter, and now with the, fcw hundreds searching in its mountains its, mineral secrets are still in effect secrets, for, thousands upon thonsands might be wander, ing through the rock-ribbed fastnesses of, our mountain ranges and their presence be, almost unknown, so vast is the extent of, country, Recent rich 7iscovcrie3 of gold deposits,, particularly in ledges, have given a great, impetus to mining throughout the county., New locations arc being constantly made,, and all show well upon the surface. The La, Foiiuna mine, recently put in opeiation,, has a 2)-stamp mill running night and day,, and the production of gold averages 75,000, per month. This mine is situated about 30, miles southwest of the village of Yuma., Rich gold discoveries have also been made, in Castle Dome, Harqua Hala, Centennial,, I\'alomas, Pot Holes, and other miping dis, tricts, and, although the mining cs Icok in, the oounty was never better, still uost oi, the silver and lead mines are idle, owing, to the low value of these metals., VALLEYS OF THE COLORADO, GILA., AND, In the vallcy3 of the Colorado and the, Gila rivers there Is roem foi thousands. It, is not too much to say that nowhere within, the limits of this broad Onion can be found, a more desirable region for the making of a, homo. No laborious clearing cf the land is, repaired; it lies almost ready for the plow., Trees and shrubht ry have so rapid a growth, that within eighteen months the immig-ant, can surround his abode with attractions, which would require years to mature in less, favored climates. Fnits ripen and are, ready for market a fall month before the, California produ\'eta. The bright sunshine, makes hie a luxury, and the pure dry atmos, phere brings health to all who inhale it. For, the establishment of colonies, such a3 are, made in southern California, Arizona pre, sents unrivaled opportunities. Thousands, of acres now profitless can be made produc, tive by the construction of irrigating ditches,, and there is no investment which assures, larger or more permanent returns., The statement in this article on Yuma, county are not exaggerated; in fact they fall, short of doing justice in this wonderful bit, of countiy. Pineapples, dates, almonds and, walunts will do well. Strawberries, rasp, berries, blackberries, currants, gooseberries,, and all varieties of small fruits can be sue, cessfully cultivated. Indeed, Yuma County, is not enly the natural home of the citrus, and scmitropical fruits, as almost every, fruit, nut, plant, grain, grass, or vegetable, which can be produced in either tropic of, temperate zones will thrive in the rich and, fertile soils., With the bright prospects ahead of the, town of Yuma and Yuma County there can, be no better investment for capital seeicing, large and renurccrativc returns than is af, forded here. With a matchless climate,, where ah forms of disease known to the, damp and rigorous regions of the cast aud, north are unknown, where the bright sun, shine kisses into bloom and fragrance every, form of vegetation, and where the clear days, aud cool and balmy nights are one long-continued, poem of happiness and delight, avc, can offer to capitalists an ideal field for in, vestment and .o home seekers a veritable, paradise in wliich to settlo., ARIZONA., Its Attractions aud Advantages as a, Place of Residence in Winter., Whitelaw Reid. owner an -1 editor of the, New York Tribune, w ho has spent the last, two winters in Arizona for the benefit of, his health, writes entertainingly and in structively, concerning that part of the, country. Mr. Reid Rays:, So many questions are asked about Ari, zona as a place for winter residence, and, there appears to be such a dearth of pre, cise information among many who are, vitally interested, that it seems almost a, public duty, to set down, in the simplest, form, a few facts of personal observation., WEATHER,, During a five mouths\' residence in, Southern Arizona in winter there was but, one day when the weather made it actually, unpleasant for me to take exercise in the, open air at some time or other during the, day. Of course there were a good many, days which a weather observer would de, scribe as "cloudy, \' and some that were, "showery; but during these five months, (from No\' ember, 1S93, to May, 1S96,), there were only four days when we did not, have brilliant sunshine at some time dur, ing the day. Even more than Egypt, any, where north of Luxor, Arizona is the laud, of sunshine. As to details:, TE5IPERATIJES., I have seen the thermometer mark 92, degrees in the shade ou my north pia\'-rzi in, March. Ou the other hand, we had frosts, which killed young orange trees, and there, were several nights when thin ice formed., J The government reports show a mean, temperature for fourteen years at the pres, ent territorial capital of 57& degrees in, Novcmbr, 53 degrees in December, 49 de, grees in January, 51 degrees in February,, i 3 (!, in Mi iiijd ..m-o.. ,., April. The same reports shaw tlie highest, uud loue.c temperatures, avcrayed for, eipht years, at the same place, a3 follows;, Kor November 78 degrees and 42 degrees,, December 73 degrees and 30 degrees,, January G5 degrees aud 32 degrees, Feb, ruary 71 degrees and 35 de rees., March SI degrees and 41 degrees and, April S6 degrees and 40 degrees. Th, nights throughout the winter are apt to b, cool enough for open wood (ires, and fo:, blankets. Half the time an overcoat i, not needed during the day, but it is never, prudent for a stranger to be without out, at hand, AXR., The atmosphere is singularly clear, tonic, and dry. I have never seen it clearer, anywhere in the worhi. It seems to have, about the same bracing raid exhilarating, qualities as the air of the Great Sahara in, Northern Africa, or of the deserts about, Mount Sinai, in Arabia Petraea. It is, much drier than 111 the parts of Morocco,, Algiers or Tunis usually visited, and drier, than any part of the Valley of the Kile, north of the First Cataract. It serins to, me about the same in quality as the air on, the Nile between Asrouan and Wady-, Halfa, but somewhat cooler., ARIZONA., Arizona stands at the threshold of an, era of wonderful social an 1 industrial de, veiopment. There can\'t be a doubt about, the fact. The dawn for which she has, waited sodonj; is breaking at last. There, is every promise of a day of great pros, pcrity aud permauent upbuilding just be, fore her. The impulse of a new and enci, gizing hope is visible everywhere among, her people, while the cumulative effect of, many things, whish made but small im, prcssion as they transpired siugly, is now, commanding for her a full share of atten, tion and interest abroad among home-, seekers aud capitalists., A lively competition has sprung up for, the possession of things which have hereto, fore gone a-begging for ownership. There, is a scramble fi-franchiscs. Nothing mor;, surely indicates a-grcat industrial awaken, ing thaU this. The rates of interest are, falling to moderate figures. Nothing more, surely indicates confidence and competition, among the money lend rs than this., Arizona has reached that climacticer, period which every western state has ex, pcticuccd sometime in its history when, after long and weary struggle and doubt., with each side of the balance first up and, then down, tVe clouds of despondency, have suddenly rolled away, and a sunhurst, of energizing hope has thrilled the droop, ing spirits of the people to greater and, braver endeavor than before., For the last twelve years the subsidence, of the great Tombstone boom and the com, pletion of two transcontinental lines of, railroad across her territory Arizona has, rather dropped out of public attention,, but in that time she has been quietly ac, cumulating a fund of substantial wealth, and a force of moral character which, qualify her now to rise up and take her, destiny in her own hands., The population of Arizona is Mexican., This is a mistake of great importance froM, the moral point of view. There is but one, considerable center of Mexican population, in the territory, the city of Tucson, and, even there it is not by any means at pres, ent the predominating element. It think, it is cm tain that Arizona has not to-day, nearly so large a Mexican population as, Colorado and not above one-tenth as much, as New Mexico.-"Fitz-Mac," in Dcnvei, News., s-o-fc, WHY IMMIGRANTS SHOULD COME TO YUMA, COUNTY., TSecausc the climate is perfect ., Because the soil is fertile and prolific., Because land is abundant and cheap., Because a home can be made with little, labor., Because so great a variety of products, can be grown ., Because the yield is large and the prices, always remunerative ., Because life is a luxury in a land where, the sun shines every day., Because there arc chances for a poor man, which he can never hope to find in older, countries., Because the country is advancing and, property values are increasing., Because, unlike Southern California it, docs not require a small fortune to secure a, niece of land., Because capital does not block all the av, enues to wealth, nor crowd the poor man, to the wall., Because Uncle Sam has jct many farms, in Yuma county waiting for occupants ., uscause cnurcnes, scuools, newspaper, and railroads are fast developing the ineral, r.nd material elements of the Territory, Because good land .is becoming scarce, and, if you don\'t catch on now, your last chance, .vill soon be gone ., Because the country is one of the few, regions of the Uuited States that yields the, products of the temperate and semi-tropit, zones., Because the worker receives a fair com, pensation for his labor, and the \'rustler\' hat, a field for the display of his energy and en, terprise ., Because there arc neither blizzards, tornadoes, earthquakes nor inundations., snow-sto: ms nor cyclones., Becaus.: the vast and varied resources oi, the country are yet to be developed ., Because the wealth of it3 mines, its farm, ing valleys, and grazing land3. will yet bull, up a great and prosperous county., Because a man can make a livelihood .icr, with less labor than in any other part of tin, United States., Because there i3 health in every breeze,, and strength and vigor under its cloudlet, skies., Because the settler noed not spend a life, time in felling trees and grubbing em, 5tump3 ., Because vegetation is so rapid that in two, years the homo is surrounded by a growth, of trees and shrubs which would require, five years to develop in a colder clime., Because fortunes here await the venture, sonic, and health welcomes the afflicted., Because the country has a brilliant future, and you want to be in the "swim.", Because in its pure, dry invigorating air,, epidemic diseases cannot live er germinate., Because its people are generou. liberal,, FHUIT CULTURE., Fruit production throughout Arizona is a sub, ject, o groat interest at present, and will no, loubt, bo the principal industry in Yuma County., Hie remarkable results that have sprung from, very superficial and imperfect culture has de, monstrated that the soil and climate of Yuma, County arc peculiarly adapted fortius branch of, agricultural enterprise. The development of those, resources is of the utmost importance and is at, tracting careful a,iention. Experiments have bcn, made, with care, and facta in regard to the culture, of different ki-nds of fruits have been collected, whjch cannot fail to convince, even tbemostskept, ical, of t\'r.j underfill superiority of Yuma County, over Southern California in fruit crowimr. and, wliich must lead to a large and varied production,, of the most remunerative character., The Commissioner of Immigration iu his report,, published in SS0, writes as follows of the rich, vallc of the Gila. Colorado and Calt rivers, \'The soil of these valleys is amon? the richest, on the continent. It is formed of the detritus, which the streams for ages have brought down, from their mountain homes in their journer to the, By constant overflows and change of channel,, the deposit of this rich vegetable matter has form, ed a soil of ixtrcnic fertility, Ncarthj streams it, is a dark Mluvial mold, well adapted to small, rains aud grasses. Farther back tnere is a rich, sandy loam, mellow and porous, and especially, favorable for fruit culture. It ha3 been already, demonstrated that the productive apacity of these, valleys is not surpassed by lands of equal area in, any part of tho United States. So rapid and prolific, is the growth of the fruits, cereals and vegetables, that the labor of tho cultivator is reduced to the, minimum, in nearly all of them two crop! a year, can be growth, and vegetation is one month ahead, of California. Tho farmere plants a cottonwppd, sapling before his door, and within tho year he has, a shade tree twenty-five feet hiirh! Alfalfa can be, cut six times during the season, and it is an actual, fact the grape-cuttings have produced within cigh, teen months! What State or Territory can make, such a showing? The climate, it must be rerncm, bored, i3 nearly perpetual summer. Snow never, falls in these southern valleys. The farmer begins, to plant in November, and b\' the middle of May, \'\'i harvest is ready. Itoscs aro in bloom, fruil, trees are blossoming, and the grair fields re a sta, of green, when the fields of the Eastern farmers, are covered with snow and ice., Every variety o grains grasses, fruits and vege, tables grown jn the temperate and semi-iropic, zones can bo produced in the valleys of Aiizotia., Wheat, corn barley, oats and all the small grains, give a yield of from twenty-five to fifty bushels to, the acre. Alfalfa, clover, timothy, Bermuda and, all the cultivated grasses grow luxuriantly, the, former giving from eight to ten tons to the acre, each year, Ever- variety of vegetable raised in, the United States can be grown in Arizona, and, nowhere are they found octter quality., "Besides the products mentioned, these semi, tropical valleys produce cotton, sugar-cane, to, bacco, hemp and rice. With the exception of the, sugar-cane, but little attcnticu is paid to the culti, vation of other staplos; but it has been demonstrat, ed that the soil and climate are specially adapted, to their successful growth. Cotton-growing is no, experiment in Arizona, for it is on record that, when the Europeans first penetrated this region,, they found the l\'ima Indians wearing fabrics, made of c, tton grown in the Gila valley., "But it is their adaptability for fruit culture, that assures to these valley lands a dense popula, tion and aprospcrous future. Almost every var, iety known can be raised in their fruitful soils. The, apple, pear, plum, peach, apricot, quince and nec, tarine, arc of delicious flavor, and give a gen, erous yield. The grape of all varieties isa home, In these sunny vales. No place in the grape-growing, belt of the Pacific Coast cali show so prolific a, yield. The quality is all that could be desired;, and the wine, although its manufacture i3 vet ex, perimental, is of a fine flavor, delicious bouquet,, and uns jrpissed by any native pi oduct as a table, beverage. Experiments wjth the raisin-grape, have shown that this climate and soil possess, every advantage for the production and curing of, this staple article of commerce., "Besides the fruits already mentioned, the or, ange, lemon, lime, olive, fig. pomegranate, and, others of the citrus family, can be grown success, fully in the valleys of Southern Arizona. Orange, trees are now in bearing in the Salt River \'alley, and at Yuma; while the bananas is also being cul, tivated at the latter place. The Arizona orange in, quality and flavor will compare favorably vith the, best California., "In the valleys of theColorada, the Salt and the, Gila livers, there is room for thousands. It is not, too much to say that nowhere within the limits of, this broad Union can be found a more desirable, region for tho making of a home. No laborious, clearing of the land is required; it lies almost, ready for the plow. Trees and shrubbery have so, rapid a growth that within eightcpn months the, immigrant can surround his abode with attractions, wliich would require years to tnatur? in less fawved, climates. Fruits ripen and are ready for market, a full month before tho California product. The, bright sunshine makes life a luxury, and the pure., dry atmosphere brings health to all who inhalo, For the establishment of colonies, such as we hav, made of Southern California a arden, Arizona, presents unrivaled opportunities Thousands, acres, now profitless, cau he made productiv, by ie construction of irrigating ditches, and there, is no investment which assures larger or more, permanent returns.", LANDS AND SOILS., The lands of Yuma county comprise the rlv, bottoms and valleys and the uplands or mesas The, bottom ands arc moistcr and slightly mere fertile, if, indeed, it is possible to m-iko comparisons, where all arc so wonderfully pwductivc and prolific, Tho uplands or mesas arc warmer and, perhaps., \'i"litly for bctterthc cultivation of the citrus fruits, Viima containsa vsrletv of soil The valley lan, of thc Gila and Colorado rivers have foi the most, part a deep sedimentary soil of brownish, gray, landy lo.nn, resting, m most places, upon a gray, clay subsoil at a depth of from ten to twenty fee, below the surface. The clay s,ubsoil forms a hard, pan which is impervious to water. These soils havi, been slowly formed by the decomposition of shales, sandstones, marls, limestones, tc, mixed with or, inie and vegetable matter, washed down by the, nighty rivers and have been gradually deposited, luring the course of centuries. Tho fertilizin,, brownish mud held in the watciof tho Colorado, md Gila rivers resembles that from the Nile, and, its quantity varies from 0. 1 to 0.5 per cent, rhou"!! tho water when oven considerably discolor, ed by mud is good t drink, resembling in this res, oect the Missouri river watur. A chemical analysis, of the sediments of the Colorado and of the Nile, 3xhibit! a wondorful similarity in the constituent, oarts of each. Thatuf the Colorado exhibiting, -.ritto less potassa, most phosphoric acid and car, jonade of limestomo beds through which the Colo, .ado pass\'s. Inotnor respaets me sauiawat of the, Colorado is almost identical with that of tho Vile,, It will be noticed, therefore, that when this water is, iscd for irrigation it is superior to artesian waters, ,ince it is constantly supplying the land with the, richest fertilizing elements. The soil of the valley, extremely rich in decomposed vegetable matter, xnd uncombined carbon, readily absorbing the, icrial gases, such especially, as oxygen, which en, tering the toil, decomposes tko organic matters so, hat thuv can be taken up and nourish the plants, .vhich may be considered a leading tcaturs 111 it, ertilitv. It s,lso readily takes up and retains, moisture, while the firmness of its particles affords, every facility for percolation and the activity of, capillary astion. In its mcchanieal composition its, particle arc in a state of very line division, which, cudcrb it more productive than coarser soils I, acquirics heat readily in the daytime, and the loss, of the heat at night is very gradual, so that it re, mains always warm and is not subject to sudden, changes of heat and cold. Besides it3 essential con, tinents of water, organic or vegetable matter,, sand and clay, a chemical analysis shows that lime,, joda magnesia, iron, nmmoi .a and available forms, of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash enter into, composition in proportions boat adapted to, add to its. fertility, though, of coarae, as is alwajs, the case in soil aualysiB, its composition varies in j, r.f,-,..,t \' ft\'V" ir-,1 \':, v.t alw as \'ot\'i-fi\'nt !, WHY CAPITAL SIIOCLD SEEK YD3IA COtJNTY, Bccnuse its mines are the richest., Because its grazing lands are the best., Because its fanning lands are valuable aw, productive ., Because it gives assurance of the largest, returns on money invested ., Because its. grand resources are 3\'ct to be, developed ., Because it i3 a young, growing csunty, with an assured future., Because the opportunities for engaging in, manufacturing enterprises are better than in, any other region of the West., Because good mining properties can be had, at reasonable figures ., Because there is a demand for additional, facilities for ore reduction., Because there are vast stretches of rich, soil to be reclaimed by the construction of, irrigating canals., Because there are large tracts of grass, lands that can be utilized by the sinking ot, artesian wells., Because there are many openings in a new, country which cannot exist in older com, munities., Because the opportunities for engaging in, the successful cultivation of semi-tropi, fruits arc better than in any other part, the United States., Because property values are rapidly ad, vancing., Because Arizona\'s boom is yet to come., CAN ONi; TJVE CO.?ORTABLV?, That again depends on what you expect., You cannot bac the luxuries of our Neu, York houses, out there, unless you buile, one; or tha variety of our New York, markets, unless you charater a refrigeratoi, car. But there are hotels with almost a, much frontage as the Waldorf; and, like, everything else in the Territory excepting, the mountains and deseits, they are new., There are boarding houses of more kinds, than one; and brick cottages of eight or, ten rooms can occasinally by rented Bet, ter than any of them, for the man with, energy and the pluck to take it, is to, on the desert; and he who knows how, "camp out" with comfort through Septem, ber in the Adirondacks can camp out in, Arizona through the winter., As to food, there is plenty, and it is, good if you can get it well cooked. The, alfalfa fields of the Salt lliver Valley are, the fattening ground for the great cattle, ranges of the Territory. From there the, markets of Los Angeles and even of Denver, are largely supplied, Good beef, mutton, and poultry are plenty and cheap. Quail,, ducks and venison from the vicinity can, also be had. Vegetables and fruits are, abundant in their season, and sometimes, the season is a long one. It is the one, country I have lived in where strawberries, ripen in the open air ten months in th, year. I have had them on my table, fresl, picked from the open garden at Christmas, ALTITUDES., It is a striking advantage offered by, Arizona that, with the same general eon, ditions as to temperature aud dryness of, air, the physician is able to select nearly, any altitude lie may desire. Thus, asth, matic suuerers can unci aimosc tne sea, level at Yuma, or an altitude of only, thousand feet at Phoenix, or of only 2,400, at Tucson. Others, who find no objection, to greater elevations, can choose betweer, Prescott or Fort Whipple, 5,400; Flag, staff. G.S00,; the Sulphur Spring Valley, or, Fort Grant, 4,200; Fort Huachuca. 4,800, or Oracle, about 4,000., WHICII TOWN IS THe 3 EST?, Primarily that is a question for the phy, sician, if there i3 a physician in the case, if not, try them all. If a mountain region,, considerable altitude and a comparatively, low temperature i3 desired, Prescott is in, a picturesque region, near a great mining, districts, and has the social advantan of, an army post, Whipple Barracks. J, stafl\'ia still higher, is in a region of, pine forests, and 13 within hard, journey of one of the wonders of the u, the Colorado Canyor- Oracle is a p, j ce, ase, y\'s, Id,, ttv, mountain nook, oowered in splendid, live oaka, like Y .so of California, and is, also near an ,iportant mining district, If lower altitude and a distinctly semi, tropical climate are desired, the three places, most likely to be considered are Yuma,, Tucson and Phoenix. The first is near the, sea level; is the warmest and probably the, driest of the three, has the least population,, and tho smallest provision for visitors, Tucson is the oldest town in the Territory,, and, after Santa Fe, perhaps the oldest in, the Southwest. Its adobe houses give it a, Mexican look, and are thoroughly comfort, able. Its newer houses are of a handsome, building stone, found in tin vicinity. The, Territorial University is 1 ere, and it was, formerly the capital. Its elevation being, more than double that of Phoenix, it is, somewhat cooler, and a3 there is next to no, irrigation near it, the air is a little drier., Phoenix is the centre of the greatest irriga, tion in the Territory. The country for, miles around smiles with green fields, cover, ed with almost countless herds of cattle,, and it is everywhere shut in by low mount, ains. It is the lerritonal camtal. has the, Government Indian School, the Territorial, Lunatic Asylum, and other institutions, and is the general focus for the Territory, Like Tucson, it has its occasional wind and, sand storms perhaps not quite so often, t either place visitors who know how to, adapt themselves to circumstances can be, entirely comfortable, and in each they will, find an intelligent, orderly, enterprising and, most hospitable community. They will, find a country full of mines, full of rich, agricultural lands, abounding in cattle and, horses, in vineyards and orchards and the, beginnings of very successful orange groves, a country, iu fact, as full of promise for, hardy and adventurous men now as Califor, nia was in the fifties. Above all, it has-, been their lot to search for health in far, countries, they will revel in the luxury of, being in their own land, among their own, ountrymen, within easy reach of their, lends by telegraph or rail, and in a climate, as good of its kind 33 anv in the world., ACTUAL HUMIOITV., This is extren sly slieht, everywhere in, rizona, as compared with any eastern, climate in the United States. The air ia, driest on the high mesas, remote from, snowclad nionatains or forests, and iii the, lesert valleys, where no considerable irri-, toWo? bas h?ri becnD, Showers, and indeed heavy rains .are, liable to occur in every month of the year;, but the actual number of rains seems to an, eastern visitor strangely small. The, average rainfall in Souther Arizana, as, shown by the Government observations, is, but 8 inches per year., ARIZONA\'S AGRICULTURAL PRO-UUCTS.-, Although thousands of acres of, land are under cultivation in Ari, zona, the agricultural developmenT, of the Territory ha? only begun., Hundreds of thousands of acres of, the most fertile soil on the con, tinent, in a land of perpetual sun, shine and in a climate conducive, to the growth ofIl the products of, temperate and semi-tropic zones,, await only the life-giving touch of, water to convert them from desert, tracts into luxurious gardpna. This, year the hot sands defy the propa, gation of vegetable life; next year, these same sands will feel the ihrob, of the irrigation vein, and where, only the desert shrubs once grew, there will spring up luxuriant vine, yardsorchards heavy with deliei, ona fruits, beautiful Rarden8 and, broad fields of grain and grasses"., A prosperous population will find, homes in the valleys of Arizona\'s, rivers, attracted not onlv by the, luxury of life in a land of eternal, sunshine, whero every breeze carries, with it a message of health and, vigor; where the scourge? of other, localities blizzards, snow storms,, floods and cyclones are unknown\',, but also by the fertile soil whosJ, wonderful fecundity will enable, man to reap the fruits of his labors, within an almost incredibly short, space of time., The soil of the A.izona valleys is, as inexhaustible as it is fertile. For, ages the streams have carried down, from the mountain districts the, detritus which forms this soil. Fre, quent inundations and shifting of, channels have caused the deposit, of the rich vegetable matters which, have made the valleys of the Terri, tory, and especially those of the, Salt, Gila and Colorado rivers?, so., wonderfully fertile. The soil ranges, from a black, alluvial mold near, the water to a rich, mellow, poroua, loam further back from the streams., The former is especially adapted to, to the growth of grain and grasses,, while the sandy loam fulfills all tho, conditions for successful fruit cul, ture. The growth of all products, fruits, cereals and vegetables is, rapid and prolific. In many in, stance? two crops are grown in a, .-ingle year, while as many as six, crops of alfalfa have been harvested, within that period., There is scarcely a locality on the, gbhe that can successfully grow as, great a variety of grains, grasses,, fruits and vegetables as Arizonar, Wheat, oats, barley, corn and all the, smaller cereals yield enormous, crops; every variety of vegetable, known in the country is grown in, Arizona, and every variety \'reaches, the acme of perfection. Alfalfa,, clover, timothy, Kaffir corn, millet, and all the grasses have Iuxariant, growth; cotton, sugar-cane, sugar, beets, hemp, rice and tobacco thrive, in the soil, while there is scarcely, a fruit under the sun apples, pears,, plums, peaches, apricots, quinces,, nectarines, dates, grapes, oranges., lemons, figs, limes, olives, pome, granates and others of the citrus, SCCil US, all Of delininn fl, that cannot be raised in the rich-,, sandy loam. Fruits ripen a month, earlier in the Territory than in, California, and in consequence of, their being placed on the early, market bring a better price than, the fruit products of the coast., The prolific and rapid growth of, vegetation is a remarkable feature, Arizona soil. A cottonwood, sapling becomes a shadetree twenty, five feet high within tu-r vpM., " - r, grape cuttings often produce within, eighteen to twenty months; the, farmer plants in November and by, .May his crop is ready to be harvest, ed. Alfalfa yields from eight to, ten tons per acre each year, and tho, ceieals from twenty-five to fifty, bushels per acre., A review of the agricultural con -ditions, that prevail in Arizona, shows that the future of the Terri, tory depends not upon her mining-, industries alone, nor on her timbers., :ior her herds and flocks of stock;, but in later years it will be found, that the era of social and intellec, tual development which she is evn, now entering upon has been fnnnf7-, ed mainly on her great agricultural, resources., Both energy and canital u-ill, required to bring about this dpvplnn-, raent; but the former is a charac, teristic of Arizona\'s population,, while the latter is daily seeking, investment within our "limits., n" Mia Graphic]']</pre>
