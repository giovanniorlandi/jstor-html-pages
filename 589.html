JONES\nWill Oppose Sen.\nMartin.\nHon. W. A. Jones, congressmai\n?Tomt he First District, has announce*\nhimself a candidate in the Demo\neratic primary to bc held Thursday\nSept 7 , to succeed T. S. Martin ii\nthe United States Senate. Mi\nJones has given out the following ic\ntervitw. which may bc regarded a\nhis platform:\n"I have not arrived at this conch\nsion hastily and inconsiderately. 0\nthe contrary, I have endeavored \\\nwe\\gh carefully the many argumen\nadvanced by those who have bec\nurging me to declare my candider\nand I am not unmindful of the diff\nculties which will confront anv Den\nocrat who ma> have the temerity\noppose the political aggregate\nwhich fraudulently assumes to be tl\nregular Democratic organization\nmy Slate, and thus arrogates on\nitself power and authority whi<\nalonc belong to the Democratic pa\nty, and which should only bc exe\ncised in the interest of all the mex\nhers ol that party.\n"If, as a consequence to the e\nexcise of my right as a Democr\nand a Virginian to enter mv patty\nprimary ie my own State I am to I\nclassed as an \'insurgent\' or enemy\nthe \'organization,\' it clearly iilu\ntra tc s the deplorable condition in\nwhich the regular party organizati<\nhas fallen. The instant any comt\nnation or group of men in the part\nwith or without their own conscr\nare designated by common consc\nas the \'organization\' or the \'machini\nI refrain from saying are so sugee\ntized, and that any good party m.\noutside of that political ring is desi\nnated as \'anti-organization\' or \'am\nmachine.\' a situation has arisen th\ndemands a remedy. I repeat, a s\nrious situation for such a cornbin\ntion is rotten with abuses. The pi\nnicious combination which deligr\nin styling itself \'the. organizatiot\nand which has never scrupled at a\nmeans to accomplish its selfish enc\nbas always endeavored to mainti\nits hold not merely by degrading <\nfice brokerage, which is men\nbribery ill-disguised, but .by acti\nfrauds at the polls. In Virginia.\nregret to say. such frauds have bc\nrepeatedly committed at party p\nmaries.\n"The pitifu\' condition of politi\nwhich has degenerated into a self\nstrife among professional politic*!\nfor the spoils and* patronage of\nfice. necessarily obscure conside\ntion of great questions of public p\nicy, and so the people of a State i\nthe nation suffer woefully. If a s\nator or other public officer is cho:\nbecause be is a member of or f ria\nly to, a certain ring or political co\nbine called or miscalled the \'orga\ngabon.\' the interests of the peo\nwhom he is to represent are conf e\nediy subordinated to those of\nring or combine, or are left out\nsight altogether. It was for 1\nreason that at the Roanoke Conv\ntion twelve years or more ago I\nfered the resolution, and at the N\nfolk convention had the supre\nsatisfaction of witnessing its trium\nant adoption, that gave the Dei\nera ts of Virginia the right to cho\na senator for themselves, and\nhave the choice made for them\nmembers of a legislature cho\njcnainly for other functions.\n"I would not seek this office\n-any other way than at ths hand:\nthe people, and I propose to sub\n?Ul the questions arising out of\ncandidacy to the people of Virgil\nface to lace, in every city and co\n.a thc State, so far as time i\nmy strength will permit. I am\nUni of the odds. The\norganization or machine\nil power,\nmy opinion, much too long, and I\nbelieve the people o* the State have\nbecome weary of the intolerable\nabuse which its urestrainec\' power\nhas brought upon them. If my\ncandidacv is. as I believe, in the in?\nterest of the people. I have confi?\ndence that they pocsess intelligence\nenough to decide for themselves,\nand I know they possess honesty,\nand love of honesty, and that they\ndesire to sec fair play.\n"My unremittedopposition to the\npolitical conditions which I have\nattempted to ddescribe, and to thc\nmen who are responsible for theil\nexistence, and who have profitec\nand continue to profit by the same.\nis not nnknown. I trust, to the peo\npie of my State. It is my hope\nthrough my candidacy to awake:\nmy fellow-Democrats of Virginia tc\na realization of the danger whicl\nlies in those conditions, and whicl\nj can only be averted by the over\nthrow and destruction of what i\npopularlv known as the \'political ma\nchine\' and \'office brokerage trust\nof Virginia.

Rexal\n"93" Hair Tonic has grown hair on\nheads that were once enid. Of\ncourse, in none ot these cases were\nthe hair roots dead, nor had the\nscalp taken on a glazed, shiny ap?\npearance.\nRexall "93" Hair Tonic acts\nscientifically, destroying the germs\nwhich are usually responsible for\nbaldness. It penetrates to the roots\nof the hair, stimulating and nourish?\ning them. It is a most pleasant\ntoilet necessity, is delicately per?\nfumed, and will not gum or perma?\nnently stain the hair.\nWe want you to get a bottle of\nRexall "93" Hair Tonic and use it\nas directed. It it does not relieve\nscalp irritation, remove dandruff.\nent the nair from falling out ano\npromote an increased growth of hair,\nand in every way give entire satis?\nfaction, simply come back and te.,\nus, and without question or formal?\nity we will hand you back every\npenny you paid us for it.
