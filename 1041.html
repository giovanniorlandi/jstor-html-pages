In\nflowers of the common nasturtium\ntrepaeoulura majus the low sun of the\nearly morning developed yellow col\noring matter, the middle sun of mid\nday stimulated the \'violets, blues and\npurples.

Coal deteriorates\nin the air, and there Is the danger of\nspontaneous combustion, while when\nsubmerged not only was the tire dan\nger eliminated, but scarcely any de\nterioration was shown.

The County Farm Bureau\nand Cow Testing Association, In co\noperation with the Dairy Extension\nSpecialist from M. A. C, J. A. Wal\ndron, ha3 worked out the following\nprogram for the tour\nIt is hoped all farmers interested\nin dairying will take in this tour and\nattend the meetings to be held in con\nnection. The tour in Van Buren\ncounty is a part of a five days tour\nin five different counties during the\ndairymen and farmers from this\ndairymen an dfarmers from this\nj county will want to take in the tour\nin some of the surrounding counties.\nThe counties to be included are Ber\nrien, St. Joseph, Branch, Barry and\nVan Buren.\n0:00 A. M. Farm of Phillip Slaugh\nter, Bangor, Mich., Arlington Town\nship. Section 18. 1 mile south of\ntown. Inspection of herd. Judging\ndemonstration by Trof A. C Ander\nson. 11:30 A. M. .

After dinner a\ntalk will be given by Mr. Burlingham\nof Hoard\'s Dairyman, and then a\ndairy cow judging contest will be the\nnext feature, in which cows whose\nrecords for the past yeai are known\nwill be used as material on which to\nwork, those taking part in the con\ntest will know Nothing about what\nthe cows performance has been dur\ning the past. All through the day\nplenty of time will be given for dairy\nquestions to be asked of the experts\npresent, also for discussions between\ndairy men and farmers. Let every\nman and woman interested in dairy\ning, take in this trip, it surely will\nbe time well spent.\nPig Club Members May\nGo to State Fair.\nThe Progressive Pig Club of Hart\nford, will train a live stock judging\nteam which will try and win one of\nthe five free trips to the State Fair\nat Detroit, which the State Fair\nassociation is offering to live stock\njudging teams. The Progressive Pig\nclub is a progressive club indeed, as\nwell as in name and there is every\nreason to believe their team will be\none of the five from the State to have\ntheir expenses paid to the State Fair.\nThe members of the club all have\nregistered Duroc Jersey pigs and\npractically all the members will ex\nhibit their pigs at the Hartford Fair\nthis fall. The Hartford Fair associ\nation is offering very liberal prize?\nfor the best pigs exhibited by pig\nclub members. This club is the only\npig club in the county at present,\nbut it is hoped several can be organ\nized next winter.\nResults from a Wheat Smut\nControl Demonstration.\nMr. R. V. Hutchins of Southern\nWaverly township put on a wheat\nsmut control demonstration last fall.\nFour acres of a ten acre field was\ntreated for smut with formaldehyde\nand six acres were left without treat\nment as a check. When the grain\nwas ripe ,and before it was cut, the\nwriter in company with Mr. Hut\nchins visited this demonstration to\nnote results from the treatment. A\ncount of the smutted heads out of\n100 treated was made at one point\nwith the result of two smutted heads\nas compared to 48 smutted heads\nout of 100 on the untreated row only\n12 inches away.\nAt another point three smutted\nheads were found out of 100 heads\nwhere the seed was treated as com\npared to 44 smutted heads out of\n100 heads where the seed was not\ntreated. If Mr. Hutchins time had\nbeen worth $50.00 per day he could\nwell have afforded to have treated\nhis seed for the untreated portion of\nthe field.\nIf any one does not know just how\nto treat their seed wheat for the\ncoming crop, get in touch with the\nFarm Bureau office and secure, with\nout cost, full direction for doing the\nwork.\nSoils Meeting at M.
