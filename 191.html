        <pre>["The Immunity of Church\nProperty\nBy JOSEPH CONRAD FEHR\nAmerican Member o f the Mixed Claims. Commission, United States \nand Germany\nR\nECENT dispatches from Moscow, \nRussia, and Etchmiadzin, Arme\xad\nnia, announced that all property \nseized by the Bolsheviki from the Arme\xad\nnian Church during the famine of 1920- \n21, consisting of thousands of dollars’ \nworth of gold and silver chalices, com\xad\nmunion cups, ikons, crucifixes and can\xad\ndelabra, as well as money, had been re\xad\nturned to the Armenian Catholics and \nthe Armenian Church by the Moscow \nauthorities. The importance of this \nnews is obvious, for this is the first time \nin the history of the Soviet regime that \nconfiscated property has ever been re\xad\nturned to any church in Russia.\nNot only Russia, but all nations that \nwere engaged in the World War, are \nnow facing many delicate questions on \naccount of the confiscatory and seques\xad\ntration measures enacted during the war \nfor the purpose of prohibiting trading \nwith the enemy— measures which in \nmany instances affected the property, \nrights and interests of the Church.\nSince the signing of the treaties of \npeace with Germany and Austria-Hun\xad\ngary at Versailles and St. Germain, \nstatesmen and lawyers in America, as \nwell as abroad, have studied the prob\xad\nlems raised by these measures. Much of \nthe property thus seized in the allied \ncountries was actually owned by church\xad\nes which are now seeking its return or \nthe equivalent. The United States has \nled the world in returning to the origi\xad\nnal owners church property so seized in \nenemy countries. It took this action on \nthe strength of an opinion handed down \nby the Attorney General and approved \nby the President of the United States, \nthat the Church, being an institution of\nGod, was not an enemy within the mean\xad\ning and intention of the Trading With \nthe Enemy act.\nWhether or not the view thus ex\xad\npressed is sound in point of law is still \nquestionable, but in the light of history \nand equity the doctrine announced by \nthe Attorney General had the support'of \nmore than 5,000 years of ecclesiastical \nprecedents. For hundreds of years all \ncivilized nations accepted • the doctrine \nof the inviolability of church property, \nas well as of the clergy, in time of war; \nExcept for the atrocities committed by. \nthe Huns and the Visigoths when they \nswooped down upon the growing Chris-, \ntian civilization of Western Europe, and \nthe universally condemned seizures of \nchurch property by the maddened mobs \nin France during the Reign o f Terror \nand in Bolshevist Russia, enlightened \nGovernments have never, as a rule, \nfailed to cloak ecclesiastical persons and \nthings with the sanctity of law and pro\xad\ntection, even during the bloodiest, o f  \nwars. Instances o f confiscation of re\xad\nligious and charitable property have \nnever occurred without obloquy. And' \nthis immunity which the Church enjoys,’ \nalthough it arose largely on account of \nthe supremacy which the Papacy in \nRome succeeded in maintaining for so \nmany centuries, has been steadfastly ad\xad\nhered to as a matter of international a? \n■well as internal policy by every civi\xad\nlized nation in Christendom.\nThe history of medieval times is re\xad\nplete with constant wars and quarrels \nbetween the sovereign powers of Europe \nwhich pledged their allegiance to the \nprimacy of the Holy Roman Empire. \nThe Church, however, was throughout\n895\n", '896 THE CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE Mar.. 1925\nthe Dark Ages sanctified by law, and \nits property,, as well as its clergy, were \ninviolate in the eyes of the civil as well \nas the canon law, in spite of recurrent \ncrusades and international strife.\nThis reverence for ecclesiastical prop\xad\nerty on the part of laymen everywhere \ncontinued even after publicists of un\xad\nquestioned reputation, such as Grotius \n(1583-1645), Bynkershoek (1673-1743) \nand Vattel (1714-1767), laid down the \nfirst principles of international law to \nthe effect that conquering nations may, \nin time of war, confiscate and seques\xad\ntrate public as well as certain kinds of \nprivate property. So firmly established \nwere the doctrines relative to the sanc\xad\ntity of Church property that these \nwriters did not even deem it essential to \ndwell at any length upon the subject. \nThus church property of all kinds, such \nas cathedrals, abbeys, monasteries and \ngifts of lands and jewels and moneys to \nthe Church have, since time immemorial, \nbeen granted the protection and sanc\xad\ntion of law and administrative policy, \neven though the legal title was vested \nin a parish or body of individuals in \nan enemy- country. For centuries em\xad\nperors and kings exhorted their legions \nto give succor to the. Church, its clergy \nand its property, regardless of locality, \nunless the clergy was employed in ac\xad\ntive warfare to the disadvantage of the \ninvading forces.\nSeizures in Wartime\nIn modern times, however, ecclesiasti\xad\ncal property and business matters gen\xad\nerally have been handled for the Church \nby the banks and brokers, acting as \nagents. Centuries ago Church owner\xad\nship of property consisted in the main \nonly of landed estates; today it com\xad\nprises money, stocks and bonds, as well \nas realty. This is particularly true of \nchurches that are incorporated, such as \nthe Roman Catholic Church and the so- \ncalled Mormon Church.\nUpon the outbreak of the World War, \ntherefore, much property really owned \nby the various Church denominations, \nbut which, on the books of firms of al\xad\nlied countries, was apparently owned\nby enemy banks and other business \nhouses, through whose agency the \nchurches negotiated their business re\xad\nlations with the temporal world, was \nseized as the property of enemies. \nThese bank accounts and securities, \nlisted in allied countries as enemy \nproperty, were therefore seized during \nthe war by the Alien Property Cus\xad\ntodians of the various nations at war \nwith Germany and Austria-Hungary and \ntheir allies, in accordance with the se\xad\nquestration legislation enacted by the \nAllies in order to assume control over \nproperty owned, or apparently owned, \nby alien enemies. One of the most per\xad\nplexing questions now confronting the \nAllies is whether or not Church property \nthus sequestrated during the war can be \nbrought under the operation of the \nClearing House provisions of the Treaty \nof Versailles in the present international \nadjustment of debt claims and repa\xad\nrations.\nIn all the history of the past 1.800 \nyears there had never been any definite \nadjudication upon this far-reaching \nproblem. Neither under the common \nlaw nor under the civil law of Conti\xad\nnental Europe were there any decisions \nwhich firmly established the interna\xad\ntional relationship of the Church in \ntime of war. Hence, statesmen, jurists, \nscholars and men trained in the law \nhave searched through their histories and \nthe earliest treatises of Littleton, Coke \nand the land-books and year-books, as \nwell as the early contributions known \nto the Roman civil law and canon law, \nin order to determine the policy of civ\xad\nilized nations in relation to ecclesiasti\xad\ncal property. These researches resulted \nin the discovery of some sound, well \nestablished principles of law and equity, \nboth municipal and international in \ntheir scope, which have an important \nbearing upon the subject under dis\xad\ncussion.\nIn the United States the situation as \nregards Church property has its com\xad\nplexities. The argument is sometimes \nmade that the Constitution of the United \nStates does not recognize any particular \nreligious creed, or even Christianity,\n', 'M ar., 1925 THE IMMUNITY OF CHURCH PROPERTY 897\nand that, therefore, the Church has re\xad\nceived no special sanction from the law, \nas in those countries which have estab\xad\nlished State religions. Holders of this \nview emphasize the fact that Church \nproperty can, under the Federal Con\xad\nstitution, be taxed, and that it usually \nis taxed, unless specifically exempted \ntherefrom by Federal or State laws. \nThe status of the Church as regards its \ncapacity to be an enemy within the \nmeaning of municipal law, and the law \nof nations, also raises the question as \nto whether moneys and other properties \nreceived by the Church under bequests \nand in the nature of gifts and grants \ncome within the ordinary province of \nthe law governing private property.\nThis question is of such depth, how\xad\never, that it warrants more serious con\xad\nsideration than a mere, reference to the \nstatute books. It has a historic back\xad\nground that has taken centuries to build \nup, and, therefore, recourse must be had \nto the early development of the com\xad\nmon law and the civil law, which had \ntheir inception in Christian principles, \nand teachings, as expounded by the \nearly leaders o f the Church. The fact \nthat both the common law and the civil \nlaw were component parts of Christen\xad\ndom, and that the law had its growth \nalong with Christianity is unquestioned.\nFor many centuries the Church ad\xad\nministered its own law and it was this \nlaw, known as the canon law, which so \nvitally influenced the civil law of Con\xad\ntinental Europe and which in England \neventually gave rise to the establish\xad\nment of courts of chancery and rules of \nequity. Many canons of this ecclesias\xad\ntical law gradually became a part of \nthe common law of England, and in that \nway many of its fundamental doctrines \nwere ingrafted upon the body of English \njurisprudence.\nThe Anglo-Saxon land books state \nin no uncertain language the views of \nthe earliest lawgivers that all Church \nproperty is owned by God. Indeed, the \nwords “ God’s property and the Church’s \ntwelvefold”  were, perhaps, the first \nwritten words in English law. A  gift \nor bequest to the Church was, therefore,\nregarded as and in effect was a dona\xad\ntion to God Almighty. It will be seen \nthen that such gifts or bequests’ were \nnever regarded as a tax upon the laity, \nimposed by the State for the upkeep of \nthe Church; instead, they were viewed \nfrom the beginning as voluntary pay\xad\nments made to God and His Church \nfrom a sense of moral obligation. This ■ \npractice the Church has continued to. \nfoster among her children. The so-- \ncalled Mormon Church is, perhaps, the • \nonly religious organization in the world \nwhich puts into practice the identical \nlaw of tithing as it originated in the • \nMosaic era. Members of the Mormon \nChurch are commanded to pay one- \ntenth of all they have or all they earn \nas a gift to God, for the furtherance of \nHis work “ among the children of men.”  \nMaxims, which in the civil law and in \nthe canon law have had the effect of \ndefinite rules of law, firmly established \nthe harmony which for centuries joined \nChurch and law together. These maxims \nalso became a part of the common law, \nand some of them are recognized in \nEnglish and American as well as \nEuropean systems of jurisprudence.\nLegal Status of Owner\nThe law o f charitable trusts, as it \nobtains in all common law jurisdictions \ntoday, is but an extended growth of the \nold ecclesiastical practice of giving unto \nGod tithes, lands, precious stones and \ngifts and grants of real and personal \nproperty of every description, to be \nused by the Church for charitable and \nreligious purposes for the benefit of \nGod Almighty. Legal scholars have re\xad\npeatedly pointed out that the nature of \nthe rules governing charitable trusts is \nsuch that the beneficial owner is not \nand need not be capable of holding the \nlegal title. This is clarified in the \ncases where property is given in trust \nfor the benefit of the poor in a parish, \nor for the purposes of education, or for \nreligious or any other charitable uses. \nIn these the beeiificiaries are usually \nunknown, uncertain and even incapable \nof taking over the legal title. How\xad\n', '898 THE CURRENT HISTORY MAGAZINE Mar ., 1925\never, these trusts are nevertheless valid \nin equity and courts of chancery are \nalways willing to protect the rights of \nthose for whose benefit the trusts were \ncreated.\nOriginally, the Chancellor was a \nChurch official, and in administering \nthe King\'s equity and justice it was his \npolicy to regard the “ cestui que use” \n(the person who uses) as the real owner \nof the property, although the legal title \nwas held by another. Upon this theory, \nequity soon began to regard all property \nheld in trust as really owned by the \nbeneficial owner, or the “ person -who \nuses,”  in spite of the law courts, which \njealously refused to take any notice \nwhatever of the beneficiary. There is \nno doubt that the development of the \nlaw governing charitable uses, as it now \nprevails in English and American law, \nwas due largely to the guidance of the \nearly Chancellors who were ecclesiasts \nhigh in the councils of the King’s Gov\xad\nernment, as well as in the Church. They \nderived their unlimited prerogatives \nfrom the powerful hierarchy of the Ro\xad\nman Catholic Church, which had, from \ntime to time, vested the holder of the \npapal office with the authority of an in\xad\nternational judge. (Period of 500 years \nprior to the days of Boniface VIII; \n1294-1303). These principals have been \nconfirmed by judicial decisions of our \nown time.\nChristianity and M odern Law\nThe fact that churches and religious \norganizations have generally received \nthe primary protection of the King and \nEmperor, both under the common law \nand under the civil law, argues that the \nprinciples of Christianity and those of \nthe Mosaic era form the basic frame\xad\nwork of European, and hence, also \nAmerican jurisprudence. And this pro\xad\ntection has been spread over Church \nproperty as well as the persons of the \nclergy. So generally have nations rec\xad\nognized this immunity in favor of the \nChurch that the question of church prop\xad\nerty rights has seldom, if ever, been be\xad\nfore the courts. Statements identifying \nthe Christian religion with the common\nlaw of a State, however, have not been \nwholly lacking. In Updegraph v. The \nCommonwealth (11 S. R. P. a., 394, \n400), however, it was stated that “ Chris\xad\ntianity, general Christianity, is and al\xad\nways has been, a part of the common \nlaw of Pennsylvania.”  Like views were \nalso expressed by Chancellor Kent, the \ngreat commentator on American law, in \nthe case of The People v. Ruggles (8 \nJohns, 290, 294, 295). And in Vidol v. \nGirard’s Executors (2 How 227, 228), \nSupreme Court of the United States, \nreference was made to the laws o f Penn\xad\nsylvania, and the Court declared that: \n“ The Christian religion is a part of the \ncommon law of Pennsylvania.”  Daniel \nWebster, when making his argument in \nthe Girard case, endeavored to establish \na ruling that a charity and charitable \nuse must, under the law, necessarily par\xad\ntake of the idea o f Christianity in ail \nor at least some of its functions. He \npointed out that these terms could not \nbe opposed to the common Christian \nfaith in its doctrine and practice.\nCourts as a whole, however, have \navoided making reference to Chris\xad\ntianity and the specific doctrines of the \nLord and Master, who, while upon the \nearth, declared, “ I am the Church"; \njust why, has never been satisfactorily \nexplained. It may be that laymen the \nworld over were so happy in establish\xad\ning the absolute temporal independence \nof their secular activities, which for so \nmany centuries had been under the con\xad\ntrol of the Church, that even jurists \nwere unwilling to recognize the rock \nfoundation, with its picturesque Scrip\xad\ntural and historic background, upon \nwhich, the law of charitable uses and \ntrust\'s was built. Only such scholars as \nthe late Justice Brewer and Justice \nHolmes of the United States Su\xad\npreme Court, Pollock and Maitland, \nand Roscoe Pound, have indicated any \nwillingness to accept the Scripture, \nwhich, since the days of Moses, has been \naccepted as the first law book of the \nworld, and imbue it with the force of \nauthority such as only case law and \nstatutory law enjoy.\nBut, aside from the- legal aspects.\n', "Mar ., 1925 THE IMMUNITY OF CHURCH PROPERTY 895\nChurch property and the persons of the \nclergy have in all civilized nations re\xad\nceived the administrative protection of \nthe various Governments. This humane \npractice not only received the commen\xad\ndation o f the earliest writers on inter\xad\nnational law, but also the favorable \ncomment of such modern authorities as \nStory, Wheaton and others. In the \nUnited States the policy of the Govern\xad\nment concerning the Church and its \nproperty, especially in time o f war, was \nthoroughly outlined in the War Depart\xad\nment’s “ Instructions for the Government \nof Armies of the United States in the \nField,”  ordered published on April 24, \n1863. The following excerpts from \nthese instructions explain the attitude \nof this Government toward the Church \nin time of war:\nAs a general rule, the property belonging \nto churches, to hospitals or other establish\xad\nments of an exclusively charitable character, \nto establishments of education or foundations \nfor the promotion of knowledge, whether \npublic schools, universities, academies of \nlearning or observatories, museums of the fine \narts, or of a scientific character, is not to be\nconsidered public property in  the sense o f\nParagrah 31; but it may be taxed or used \nwhen the public service may require it. * * *\nThe United States acknowledges and pro\xad\ntects, in hostile countries occupied by it, re-' \nligion and morality; strictly private property; \nthe persons of the inhabitants, especially\nthose of women, and the sacredness of domes\xad\ntic relations. Offenses to the contrary shall \nbe rigorously punished. This rule does not \ninterfere with the right o f the victorious in\xad\nvader to tax the people or their property, to \nlevy forced loans, to billet soldiers, or to \nappropriate property, especially houses, lands, \nboats or ships and churches, for temporary \nand military uses.\nCourts making adjudications in ac\xad\ncordance with municipal law will, per\xad\nhaps, avoid any direct rulings upon the \nissues pertaining to this subject matter \nshould they ever become the basis of \nlitigation because of the grave theologi\xad\ncal speculations involved therein. It is \nquite probable, however, that The \nHague Tribunal and the newly organ- \nzied World Court at Geneva, as well as \nthe various mixed arbitral tribunal; \ncreated under the Treaty of Versailles, \nwill be called upon in due course to \nmake decisions upon these .far-reaching \nquestions because of their international \nscope. 1\nThe matter of immunity o f Church \nproperty is one calling sharply for con\xad\nclusive adjudication by a competent \ntribunal. Vast assets throughout the \nworld are involved and- the question \nwill continue a pressing international \nissue until some legal authority settles \nit for all time.\n"]</pre>
