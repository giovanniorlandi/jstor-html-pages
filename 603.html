The state bor\nrowed money from the common school,\nuniversity and agricultural funds to\nhelp prosecute the civil war and issued\nCertificates of Indebtedness. Ever\nsince that time a tax amounting to\n$157,570.00 annually has been levied\nagainst the taxable property of the\nstate; of this amount $109,469.00 goes\nto the common schools and the balance\nto the university and college of agri\nculture.\nFree High Schools and Graded\nSchools—The items for free high schools\nand graded schools will not be misun\nderstood. These levies are collected by\nthe state and apportioned to the several\nhigh and graded schools which have\nattained a certain standard. All prop\nerty is taxed for these purposes, but\nthe counties having the largest number\nof graded or high schools receive? most\nin return.\nThe University- Explanation unnec\nessary.\nT r Common Schools—This is the so\nca.,\'*d “Mill Tax” (really seven-tenths\nof a mill), which is levied by the state\non all taxable property and apportioned\nto the counties per capita, according to\nthe school population.\nThe State Highway Tax The slate\nhighway tax is levied by the state and\nreturned to the several counties as they\ncomply with the highway law.\nThe foregoing items constitute what\nis commonly known as the “Stale Tax"\nbecause it is levied uniformly against\nall taxable property in the slate.\nThe remaining items on the state\nment are not. in any sense, a state lax:\nThe first, for charitable and penal\npurposes, is charged against the coun\nties at the rate of $1.50 per week for\neach inmate from said county in county\nasylums.\nThe special loans and school district\nloans represent repayments of amounts\nborrowed from the trust funds and ex\npended locally. They do not constitute\na state tax and the money is returned\nto the tru-;t funds, which are never ex\npended, but loaned at interest to school\ndistricts, counties and municipalities.\nThe amounts returned to the counties\nare self-explanatory, but additional\nsums, not shown on these statements,\nare paid from the general fund to aid\nrural schools, county agricultural and\nteachers’ training schools, teachers’ in\nstitutes and for special instruction for\nthe deaf and blind.\nDuring the fiscal year ending June\n30, 1912, the total state tax, except for\nthe university, was $2,238,448, while the\namount returned to the counties and\nvarious local educational institutions\nwas $2,908,724.\nNew York and Wisconsin United.\nFor some time cupid has been playing\nwith heart strings that spanned from\nthe jungles of Wisconsin to the great\nami classic metropolis of Now York.\nThe result is found in the following\nwords, neatly engraved and enclosed\nto the Tribune publisher ;\n‘‘Mr. and Mrs. Bernard C.

The best of\nmedical skill and treatment, both here\nand for months at a sanitarium, could\nt.rt arrest the progress of the fatal ill\nness, which came upon her at a stroke.\nFor years no one ever enjoyed better\nhealth, and this health was freely given\nin kindly service, not only to her home,\nbut to the church and to the communi\nty.

A\nstate pamphlet of 125,000 words, ex\nplaining the arguments for and against\neach, is sent to voters. Don’t you wish\nyou were going to vote in Oregon?\nIt is up to the voter to decide which\nis the best to tie to, which is best for\nthe country Taft, Wilson or Roose\nvelt. There are their deeds and their\nfollowing to judge by. Two have been\ntested, the other not. The Tribune is\nnot enthusiastic for either but must\nadmit that the present encumbent will\nnot fall short in comparison.\nTHEIR MUTUAL DISRESPECTS.\nMilwaukee Sentinel.\nIt is Col. Roosevelt’s peculiar dis\ntinction that he can do and say things\nwhich no other public man can do and, in\npopular parlance, “getaway with it.”\nHe is running with might and main\nfor a third term in the face of his\npleon that “under no circumstances”\nwould he break the "wise custom’’ to\nthe contrary. To a considerable extent\nhe is “getting away with it.”\nHe now invades Wisconsin, and pro\npounds the paradox oi classing La Col\nlette with the “reactionaries.” It re\nmains to he seen how far he can “get\naway with" that.\nThe colonel’s assault on La Collette\nas a “reactionary” synchronizes handi\nly with Lh Collette\'s magazine assault\non him as a "reactionary.” It affords\ncomparatively impartial observers an\nopportunity to compare the respective\nappraisals of these two worthies of\neach other.\nThe gist of the colonel’s endorsement\nof La Collette is that he was “progres\nsive” up till the time when he, Roose\nvelt, became a candidate last winter,\nafter which time La Collette joined the\nranks of those who "claim to be pro\ngressive” while giving aid and comfort\nto the "reactionaries."\nThe gist of La Collette’s appraisal of\nRoosevelt is that he never was and is\nnot now a “progressive” at all, hut is\nengaged m a purely personal adventure\nbegun when he had convinced himself\nthat Taft could be beau n for the nom\nination by a “progressive." and that it\nwould he worth his while to turn “pro\ngressive’’ and bilk La Collette out of\nthe candidacy which was clearly mak\ning headway.\nSpeaKing at Oshkosh, Col. Roosevelt\nrepresented that La Collette had al\nways approved of him till the time\nwhen he, Roosevelt, found things were\nabout ripe for him to throw his hat in\nto the ring.\nAccording to La Collette, that is very\ninaccurate, for he relates how he re\nsisted every attempt to coax or trick\nhim into indorsing Roosevelt as tit for\na “progressive" candidacy. At the\nWashington conference he distinctly\ndeclared to Pinchot and others that\nRoosevelt “had no settled convictions’’\nin “progressiveism,” and no “construc-\ntive ability," and that his candidacy\nwould tend to defeat real progress,’\nAttemplu failing to persuade La Col\nlette to stamp Roosevelt with approval\nas a “progressive,” trickery of a shady\nsort was resorted to, for the senator\nrelates how Medill McCormick once at\ntempted to abuse his position in the La\nCollette publicity bureau to Roosevelt’s\nadvantage by “tampering with our\nliterature. ’’\nThe obviously weak point in Roose\nvelt\'s claim that to oppose his can\ndidacy means to “range one\'s self\nagainst the ‘progressive’ movement’’\nis that the majority of the foremost\nand original “progressives,” as La Col\nlette. Hadley, Borah, Gronna, etc., are\nopenly opposing it.\nThis third term third party is very\nclearly a personal adv unture of the col\nonel’s own, born of his candidacy and\nto expire with it.\nTo the founding of a real new party\nmuch more is required than a personal\nambition inflamed by a personal grudge.\nSchool Board Proceeding*.\nMineral Point, Sept.. 2 1912.\nA regular meeting was this day held\nin fire building.\nMeeting called to order by Pres.\nFiedler.\nMembers present\' Fiedler, Chamley,\nMorgan, Jacka, Knight and Hnbenthal.\nMinutes of last regular and special\nmeeting read and approved.\nFollowing hills were read and audited;\nStandard Oil Cos., £1 ZV\nJog.

Of course, the individual\nis to blame, generally speaking.\'* The\nstomach is one of the most abused\nt rgans in the human body, not be\ncause the average individual desires \\o\ninjure himself, but because, in ignor\nance of the laws of health, he commits\nerrors in diet that promote acidity and\ninflammation of the stomach.\nThe common and easily recognized\nsymptoms of stomach trouble are loss\nof appetite, food is distasteful, later\nvomiting and pain, pressure on the\nsurface over the region of the stomach\nis unbearable on account of the ex\ntreme soreness resulting from the in\nflammation. There is apt to be a bad\ntaste in the mouth, with dryness of\ntongue and more or less fever. In\nsome cases dizziness and headache are\nnoted, and there is a burning thirst not\neasily satisfied by drinking cold water.\nIt is\' only a step from these described\nconditions to the chronic stages, when\nthe fever grows less but the mucus\naccumulates rapidly and the digestive\nfluid is diminished so that the food\nlies for hours in the stomach, undi\ngested, and decomposes into gas and\ncertain other irritating and poisonous\nbodies.\nConstipation generally follows, with\nswelling of the stomach and abdomen,\nand the victim becomes weak, nervous,\ndepressed and exceedingly miserable.\nAt times there are attacks of pain,\nnausea or sickness at the stomach.\nThe attacks may occur frequently or\nweeks may elapse between them. The\nconstipation may be interrupted by\nspells of looseness of the bowels and\nthe discharge of gas. Oftentimes when\nthe accumulation of gas is pronounced,\nthe pressure is so great as to cause pains\nin the heart and the victim immediately\nfears some organic heart trouble. As\na climax to the difficulty that originates\nin the digestive organs, the victim is\npoorly nourished, loses flesh, grows\nweak and pallid, becomes listless, in\ndifferent and low-spirited: in short, he\nbecomes a “chronic old dyspeptic” as\nthe common saying goes.\nIf you have pain in the stomach,\nloss of appetite, what you think is\ndyspepsia or indigestion, bad taste in\nthe mouth or foul breath, sick headache,\ncatarrh, gas, gnawing sensation, nervous\nness, heartburn, bloated fee\'ing, then\nyour stomach\nirtTii? ■\'--w trouble has be\njJfS come a chronic\nMgF*\' fact and tl\nSr;\nW \' ’ sistancc becomes\na necessity.

Here is a Mineral Point\ncitizen’s recommendation:\nGecrge Hartley, State St.. Mineral\nPoint, Wis., says; “I value Doan’s\nKidney Pills as highly today as when I\npublicly recommended them in August,\n1907. The statement I gave at that\ntime was correct. Whenever my kid\nneys do not act properly and cause\nbackache and other symptoms of kidney\ncomplaint, I take a few doses of Doan’s\nKidney Pills, procured at Ivey\'s Phar\nmacy, and am promptly relieved.”\nFor sale by all dealers.
