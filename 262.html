The British and Greeks on the\nAllied right are battering their way forward across the steel\nBelauchista bridge. Northwest of Poiran lake the Greeks tonight\nare approaching the crest of the mountains. The British reached\nDzuma Obasi. British forces marching on Strumitz are well\nacross the Bulgarian border. The latest dispatches had them\nnear Kosturino, six miles south of Strumnitza. Meanwhile the\nSerbians on the left main are attacking the front. Italians on the\nextreme left have made further great strides toward encircling\nthe routed Bulgarian armies. They entered inside making an\nadvance of forty miles since the capture of Prilep two days ago.\nTo the east of the Vardar too the Serbians are smashing\nnorthward, and captured the station of Gradsko, overcoming ah |\nresistance rendered mainly by German units. Here they took an\nimmense lot of supplies- Reports state the Prilep-Vesles road has\nbeen cut at over sixteen miles north of Prilep, this means the last\navenue of escape of the first Bulgarian army is cut off. This\narmy must now turn westward to the All »anian mountains j\nwhere Italians are fast approaching.\n—\n• \'\nEnd of Turkish Rule In Palestine\nLONDON, Sept. 26.—The last act of the Turkish drama in,\nPalestine is being enacted. The fourth Ottoman army of thirty- j\nfive thousand is hopelessly trapped by the British and faces an-;\nnihilation. This will mean a total of eigthy thousand Turks |\nkilled or captured and the liberation of Palestine from Turkisn\nmisrule.\nSuffrage Fight in the Senate\nWASHINGTON, Sept. 26.—The first day of the fight for\nwomlens suffrage in the senate ended in a drawn battle with the.\nsuffragists bringing up reinforcements.

This is a case\nwherein the plaintiff brings\nsuit for SIO,OOO damages for in\njuries received „ while working\nfor the company as a miner.\nThe injuries consisted of a\nbroken shoulder and arm which,\nit was alleged, incapacitated\nhim for work at his chosen avo\ncation- The jury selected for\nthe trial of the case was com\nposed of the following gentel\nmen: Thomas Woods, O. F.\nAshburn, O. F. Harpole, C. C.\nThe Daily Morning Oasis\nNordholm, D. W. Canfield, W.\nA. Parker, Charles F. Davis, W-\nD. Corson, T. B. Titus, A. B.\nAnderson, August Jepson and\nHarry Dolson.\nThe arguments of counsel\nwere completed and the case\ngiven to the jury at about 2:30\np. m- After being out a little\nless than an hour they brought\nin a verdict for the plaintiff in\nthe sum of $3,000.\nIn these damage cases The\nOasis representive was given a;\n“bum steer,” to use a police de\npr: ment classic, and had\nthings somewhat mixed. It\nwas Alex Wurkovitch who,\nbrought suit for $20,000 dam\nages for the loss of an eye. (\nwhile employed as amines by\nthe Montana Myies Co., and was\nawarded $5,300 by the jury\nWednesday—not John Erkkila,\nas stated. The latter’s case was\nthe one disposed of yesterday.\nAll the other papers, following\ni The Oasis* as usual in matters\ni of news made the same mistake.\n“Equal Rights For All; Special Privileges For None.”—Andrew Jackson.\nKEEPING THE HOME FIRES BURNING\n8 1\nHere is a little bit of home which may be found in any Army Y.

The big open fireplace, the curtained\nwindows, the cozy corner, and the little feminine touches which have been\nadded by friends of the “Y,” all contribute to the comfort and morale of the\nsoldier away from home.\nHere the soldier will find a happy substitute for the home fireside, with\nmusic if he prefers it—the home paper—good magazines—a game of check\ners with his chum, and a lot of other things that help to make life interesting\nfor the soldier. This Is the social room which may be found in nearly every\nArmy Y. M. C. A. hut.

YOUNGEST SOLDIER IN\nPERSHING’S FORCES, IS\nMOURNED BY ARMY.\nHIS HEROIC DEATH RELATED\nRed Cross Establishes Tailor Shop in\nBerne to Supply Captured American\nOtficers With Uniforms—New Plan\nfor Training Flyers.\n(From Committee on Public Information.)\nWashington.—Private Albert E.\nScott, the youngest soldier In General\nPershing's army In France—he was\nbut fifteen years of age and a Brook\nline, Mass., high school boy when he\nenlisted —Is dead, shot through the\nhead by a German Sniper after he had\nlaid thirty foes to rest, and the army\nmourns its boy hero.\nA soldier writer for The Stars and\nStripes, the A. E. F. paper, tells this\nstory:\n“In the regiment they are talking\nthese days of all the good pals they\nlost In the fierce, unfortgettable chase\nthey gave the Germans in the great\nretreat from the Marne. But most of\nall—a little oftener and a bit more\nfondly—they talk of Scotty.\n“He was a good kid, they say, and\nhe died on his gun.\n“His great chance came when on\nthat historic July 18 his regiment got\nthe order for which, through many a\nmonth of dreams, it had longed—the\norder to advance. It went 18 kilome\nters without stopping, chasingtheßoche\nup hil! and down dale, fighting its way\nthrough patch after patch of inviting\nwoods that would prove treacherous\nwith hidden machine guns.\n“In the first days of that battle, the\nmovement was so swift that more than\nonce a small German rear guard and an\nadvance Yank platoon would meet in\nthe forest and fight out then and there\na complete and separate battle all their\nown. So it was with the Indians, as\nScotty’s regiment was nicknamed, one\nafternoon, as they were making their\nway pest the bitterly won town of\nEpieds.\n“At the cross road they saw troops\napproaching them in column of squads.\nThe officer in charge caught Aem in\nthe focus of his field glasses. They\nwere Boches, coming on. The Yanks\nwaited, itching to open fire, but biding\ntheir time. Suddenly the Boches de\nserted the road and came on them\nthrough the forest.\n“The lieutenant placed his men along\na roadside ditch. He placed Scotty\nand his sho-sho beside a tree and\nsquarely opposite a narrow woodland\npath that opened across the way. He\ncould see straight down that patlT, and\nthe Boches were bound either to come\nalong it or to cross it.\n“ ‘See that path, Scotty?’ said the\nlieutenant. ‘That’s your target Not\none of them must cross It.’\n“ ‘Yes, sir,’ said Scotty, and dropped\nbeside his gun.\n“Then from the high branches of\nmany a tree and from many a shelter\nthe German fire opened, and the Yank\nfire answered.\n“A gray figure darted suddenly into\nthe leafy path. He fell.\n“Another appeared. He fell.\n“There was perhaps ten minutes of\nthat, and what was left of the German\nparty was withdrawing when a handful\nof soldiers scampered along the road.\nThey were Germans, but they shouted\nas they ran, ‘Don’t shoot, we’re Amer\nicans.’\n“For a moment, just for the space\nthat a breath is held, Scotty thrust his\nhead up to see. From his perch in\nsome tree a sniper shot him in the\nforehead. Another bullet found his\nheart. He fell forward, dead, on his\ngun.\n“They had killed him, but the num\nber of their dead that are counted as\nhis was thirty.”\nRoller skates as a part of the speed\nup program in force at the Rock Island\narsenal, Illinois, have been adopted by\nwomen messenger employees.\nWomen employed In the tifne divis\nion at the arsenal are voluntarily work\ning the first Saturdays and Sundays of\neach month closing the pay roll sheets\nso that all arsenal workers may be\npaid promptly.\nAccording to the “Arsenal Record,’\npublished by the employees, Rev. M. E.\nKrotzer, pastor of the Presbyterian\nchurches at LeClaire and Princeton,\nlowa, is putting in his five weeks’ va\ncation as an arsenal worker. The same\npaper reports the fiftieth anniversary\nas an arsenal worker at Rock Island of\nEmil Beck, seventy years old, Inspector\nin the tin shop, who went there when\ntli* arsenal consisted of a small group\noi vooden buildings, relics of Civil war\nd: \\s, and employed from 200 to 400\nteen only through the summer months.\nCuba has a closing law which shuts\nall stores, warehouses, shops, etc., In\nthe larger cities at 6 p. m. week days,\nand all day Sundays, Retail food\nstores keep open until 8 p. m. week\ndays and 10 p. m.

The new\nmaterial will be made of lava and lime,\nCaptured American army and navj\nofficers are reaching German prison\ncamps without clothing and shoes. The\nAmerican Red Cross has established a\ntailor shop in Berne to supply them\nwith proper uniforms, according to in\nformation just reaching the bureau oi\nprisoners’ relief.\nThe officers, it seems, in being hus\ntled back from the front by their cap\ntors lose their overcoats, blouses and\neven trousers. Frequently their leatli\nei shoes, which are greatly coveted by\nthe Germans, are taken from them, and\nthey are forced to wear wooden shoes.\nThe clothing of others is so damaged\nin strenuous fighting as to need re\nplacement\nTo outfit the forty commissioned\nAmericans known to be in the German\ncamps and others who may be captured\nlater, the Red Cross purchased a tail\nor shop in Paris and moved tailors and\noutfit outright to Switzerland. This\nshop is now turning out each week 12\nuniforms made to measurements sup\nplied by mail by the various prisoners\nIn the various camps. The men are\nsupplied also with underclothing, shoes,\ntoilet articles, towels ijnd food. The\nfood is particularly necessary to sup\nplement the meager prison fare for\nwhich the Germans make the captured\nofficers pay in money.\nThe stripping of prisoners apparent\nly takes place only at the front in the\nheat and confusion of battle. Camp\ncommittees, appointed by the prisoners\nthemselves, see that American prison\ners receive supplies sent them.\nExperienced flying officers are being\nreturned from abroad to act as special\ninstructors in the more advanced cours\nes of aviation training which is being\ndeveloped by the air service.\nRecent practice in elemental train\ning now’ gives the candidate more time\nIn the air with his instructor than here\ntofore. The new’ plan is known as the\nGosport system or “Ail .Thru,” as it\nis popularly called here, and insures\ncloser contact between the cadet and\nInstructor. When the cadets arrive at\na flying field from the ground school,\nwhere they have learned much of the\ntheory of flight, engine control and re\npair, radio, signaling arid other kindred\nsubjects, several of them are assigned\nto an instructor who stays with them\nuntil they are qualified in elemental\nflying. They are then sent to the spe\ncial schools for final work and train\ning in their particular linei as pursuit,\nreconnaissance, artillery control, or\nbombing pilots. The old practice of\ngiving a cadet so much time in she air\nunder instruction and then turning him\nloose for his first solo flight, in a “sink\nor swim” fashion, is being discontinued,\nand what is believed to be a more safe\nand sane system is being adopted.\nOrganization of forty air squadrons\nhas been authorized. Four will be lo\ncated at Houston, Tex., and 36, or a\ntraining brigade of three wings, on\nLong Island, N.

These\nsquadr .ns are to serve under field con\nditions simulating, aB nearly as prac\nticable, the conditions behind the lines\nIn France.\nInformation received by the chil\ndren’s bureau of the department of\nlabor seems to indicate that every\nwhere In the United States children\nare receiving less milk than they\nshould have. Such decreases are un\ndoubtedly due In part to the high cost\nof milk. It is the poorest families,\nthat have been forced to make the\ngreatest reduction in the amount of;\nmilk purchased. But that reduction j\nwould perhaps not be so great, the j\nchildren’s bureau says, if all mothers\nfully realized the value of food in the\ndiet of their children.\nMilk has been called the “perfect\nfood.” Authorities agree that it sup\nplies the elements necessary to the\ngrowing child in the most digestible\nform. In spite of its increasing cost,\nit supplies those elements also in the\ncheapest form. It is estimated that,\non the basis of its nutritive value,\nmilk compared with steak at 40 cents\na pound, and eggs at 48 cent 9 a dozen,\nshould be priced at about 27% cents\na quart.\nWorkers for Children’s Year, to\nwhom the weighing and measuring\ntest for children under five yeggs of\nage has revealed how many children\nin the United States are undeveloped '\nas a result of improper diet, are en\ngaged in campaigns to bring the im\nportance of milk to the attention of\nmothers and to make It possible for\nthem to procure enough milk to keep\ntheir children strong and well. Many\nmilk stations where mothers may re\nceive pure silk at a nominal cost, or\nfree, if they cannot afford to pay for\nit, have been established in connec\ntion with children’s year work, and\npublic measures for ensuring a pure\nand adequate milk supply have been\nundertaken in many communities.\nAmong these measures are the estab\nlishment of pasturization plants, the\ninspection of the milk supply, and the\npassing of regulations controlling dis\ntribution.\nThe total value of all imports into\nthe United Kingdom during the\nfirst six months of 1918 were $3,178,-\n851,129; of exports, $1,201,211,086.\nFor the same period of 1916 the val\nues were: Imports, $2,310,730,038 ; ex\nports, $1,176,758,033.

Already a variety of\nnew materials is on the shelves of the\nstores and in the stock rooms of the\nfactories. Whoever needs a wool suit\nwould best buy It early in the season\nbefore the supply runs out. It may\nhave to do service for the next three\nyears; but it is easy to put up with\nthis state of things. If all the wool is\nneeded for the ever-increasing army,\nwomen will do without it.\nThere are on hand just now suits\nand coats for fall in good wool mate\nrials and in many graceful styles. One\nof them is shown above in a practical\nand plain model that will prove a good\nInvestment. It will be noticed that\nthe skirt is longer than for several\nseasons. This Is an echo of French\nstyles, which may or may not be ac\ncepted in America. American wom\nen like the cleanliness of shorter\nskirts and they also like their most\nbusinesslike style and may insist that,\nin street suits at least, the mandate\nfor longer skirts be disobeyed.\nGood Designing in Separate Skirt\n| mm— j\nThose very handsome separate\nskirts that came in along with rich,\nnew fabrics for summer set a pace\nfor elegance and style that is not\neasy to keep up with. But the sep\narate skirts for fall measure up to\ntheir standard, which is saying more\nfor these heavier skirts than could\never be said before.\nMany of the new skirts are made of\ncloths woven especially for them.\nThese goods are plain, with borders\nin wide or narrow bands in contrasting\ncolors, or patterned with wide bands\nin alternating colors over all their sur\nface, or bordered with cross-bar bands,\nor perfectly plain. Now that the looms\nare busied with the affair of the sep\narate skirt we may expect revelations\nin fine designing. In all the new mod\nels pockets, large buttons and novel\ngirdles—nearly always wide—are style\nfeatures on which designers have cen\ntered attention.\nIn wool goods for plain skirts, jer\nsey cloth remains a favorite and in\nsilk poplin is not outrivaled as yet,\nThe suit pictured is of Himalaya\ncloth with large revers and an over\ncollar of plush. The coat has a plain\nbody with skirt pointed at each side\nand plaited on. It is bound with silk\nbraid. A narrow belt wraps -Twice\nabout the waist, once following the\nhigh waistline in the body and again\nabout the top of the coat skirt. It\nis also trimmed with silk braid.\nUneven length in coats makes grace\nful suits, but this style feature passed\nthe zenith of its popularity during the\nspring and summer. Coats in nearly\nall the new suits are cut straight\naround the bottom, are moderately\nlong, and many of them have large\npockets. Convertible collars are meet\ning with such favor that we are sure\nof this comfortable and chic neck fin\nishings for the coming fall and win\nter at least.\nIn colors brown, blege and blue\nhave the lead, with all shades of brown\nin strong demand. But one cannot\nmake a mistake in choosing any one\nOs them.\nalthough tricot may soon take the\nlead. The skirt shown in the picture\nis an example of good designing in a\nseparate skirt since it is modish and\ngood looking. It is of rose-colored\nwool jersey with slit pockets on each\nside, finished at their edges with dou\nble rows of machine stitching. The\nskirt Is gathered with a little fullness\nat the front and more at the sides and\nback, to a moderately wide waistband.\nIt fastens at the left side where the\nwide tab extending from the top of the\ngirdle Is fastened down with a snap\nfastener.\nCleaning Corduroy.\nPlunge up and down In warm soapy\nwater, using a pure white soap.

The overseas’ record was\nmade while American soldiers were\nparticipating In the heavy fighting in\nthe Marne salient, when they were\ncompelled frequently to sleep and eat\nunder the most primitive conditions.\nThat this record is truly representa\ntive of the general health of the troops\nis shown by the combined reports\nwhich indicate the figure of 2.8 per\n1,000 as the average death rate from\ndisease during the past two months.\nAn idea of the progress being made\nin military sanitation is gained by a\ncomparison with the following: During\nthe Mexican war the annual death rate\nfrom disease was 100 per 1,000. Dur\ning the American Civil war the rate\nin 1862 was 40 per 1,000, while during\n1863 the rate Jumped to 60 per 1,000.\nThe disease death rate for the Spanish-\nAmerican war was 25 per 1,000. As\nfar as available records show the low\nest figure heretofore recorded was 20\nper <IOO during the Russo-Japanese\nwar.\nTwo men of the American navy\nproved themselves heroes and won\ncommendation from Secretary Dan\niels for the rescue of seven men from\nthe burning Spanish steamship Ser&n\ntes July 13 last. They are William E.\nKing, seaman, and Clarence F. Ready,\nmachinist’s mate, second class, U. S.\nN. R. F„ of the U. S. 8. Isis.\nThe two men took the port launch\nof the Isis to the side of the burning\nship and rescued from the burning\nforecastle seven men who were\nhemmed in by flames and who were\ntoo panic stricken to Jump into the wa\nter.\nThe launch\'s trip to the Serantes\nwas made through an area of burning\ngasoline and the rescuers were in con\nstant and imminent peril. Their com\nmanding officer reports that the con\nduct of King and Ready during this\ntime was cool and courageous. They\nprobably owe their own lives and the\nlives of those they rescued to their\nsteady nerves and cool Judgment. Their\ncommendation was for bravery and\ntheir initiative in undertaking the res\ncue.\n!\n| The army general staff has complet\ni ed plans for expansions at some of\nthe camps and changes at training cen\nters. Additional plans are being\nworked out and will be put into ef\nfect.\nCamp Hancock, Georgia, is to be a\nmachine gun center and will be en\nlarged to accommodate between 55,000\nand 60,000 men. The officers’ training\nschool now housed In tents at this\ncamp will be provided for in barracks\nand quarters similar to those at other\ncantonments. These Improvements\noutside of enlargement of the camp,\nwill cost about $2,000,000.\nIt been decided to make Camp\nGrant an Infantry replacement camp\ntQ accommodate between 55,000 and\n60,000 tr.en. The present capacity of\nthis camp is about 42,000. The altera\ntions and changes necessary will be\nmade after the division now located\nthere has been removed.\nField artillery firing centers are to\nbe located at West Point, Ky., Camp\nJackson, S. C., and Fayetteville, N. C.\nOptions on sufficient land for this pur\npose have been secured at all these\nplaces. It Is planned to locate six\nbrigades at Fayettesville, six at West\nPoint and four at Jackson.\nIt has been decided also to erect\npermanent buildings for the officers’\ntraining schools at present housed in\ntents at Camps Lee, Gordon and Pike.\nThese schools have a capacity of about\n6,000 men.
