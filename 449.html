He\nrather seems to prefer to remain quiet,\nand to listen to whnt others say. F\nam of the opinion, however, from the\nlittle that he dors say, ft uh time to\nCnie, that he has not loyt any of his\nformer gn i,"\n»\nCompany Will Try to prove\nThat Uppers Are More\nDesirable Than\nLowers\nWashington. June 1 Although this\nis the date on which the Interstate\nCommerce Commission’s order redtic*\nii\'g the price of Pullman berths was\nto take effect, the quotations on that\narticle remain Jlrm and steady, with\npossibilities of an upward tendency.\nAs a matter of fact, it may be for\nyears and tt may be forever, before\nthe travelling public enjoys any re\nduction in Pullman fares. The Pull\nman Company will probably tight the\nmatter out to the last ditch. Officials\nof the corporation deny the right of\nthe commission to regulate their af\nfairs, and are esp< dally indignant at\ntiie Idea that there should be a dir\nft rential between upper and lower\nberths, or. in other words, that upper\nberths should in* lower than lower,\nbt rtlis. Lawyers for the company are ■\ngathering facts, figures and statistics\nto prove that ‘upp< rs" nr* really uiori\ndesirable than “ lowers."\nThe chief point upon which the\nPullman company will base its fight\nis tin* jurisliction of the commission\nIt was not until the passage of the\nHepburn \\ct in 19m; that It was ex\npressly noted that the commission\nshould have jurisdiction over the;\nsleeping car companies and the ex\npreps companies. I\'pon that basis the\ncommission forced the Pulman com\npany to tile Its rates as the railroads\nhave always been doing. The Pullman\ncompany tiled the rates, but upon each\nInstance these tariff sheets carried the\nnote that the company reserved the\nright to contest the jurisdiction of the\ncommission.\nHy making such a note on their tar\niff sheets the Pullman company show\ned that it was expecting that at some\ntime such a ease as tills would come\nup before the commission, it has been\nintimated that the Pullman company\nwould a vail itself of the dissenting\nopinions that were filed by Chairman\nKnapp and Commissioner Harlan, but\nupon a review of these opinions there\nis not much or practical Importance,\nit is believed, that the Pullman coin\njpany can mike use of.\nNo doubt it will lie some lime .be\nfore flu* general public can get the\nbenefit of the reduced rates, even if\n] upheld, b* ause in tin- first place only\na very few rates were ordered to be\ni reduced.\nFREIGHT RATES\nSHOW INCREASE\nWashington, June 1.-Freight rates\nfiled with the Interstate Commerce\nCommission, to go into effect today,\ni show n general Increase In rates from\ni western ter *itory to the Atlantic sea\nboard.

He had eaten nothing ,\nsince the day before.

There was a sharp report,\nand the helmsman found that the\n‘wheel turned without assistance.\nSomething had happened to free tlie \'\nrudder and render It useless.

Orders were issued to g >t up such\nsails as would lie of service in steer- I\nitig. With the help of these, though\nthe ship steadily lost ground, those |\naboard of her gained time.

He* was no:\nonly becoming benumbed with the cold\nbritli, but must be ever watchful to\navoid being hanged against the side\nof the vessel, which would, to say\nthe least, have dislodged him.\nAnd so lie continued to light for the\nlives of tile fifty or more people slow\nl.v drifting toward the breakers, whose\ndistant roar could now be faintly* heard\nnbove that of tlie wind. IIvery time\nIn* was carried down lie cam© up with\nshorter breath and more exhausted\nHut every time he renewed his at\ntempt to put the rope through tin*\nring of the swaying rudder. Then,\nwhen he had failed and gone down\nAgain, on rising lie let go the ring to\nrest, swinging, soaked with ice water\nand pierced by the cold wind.\nAt last, watching his opportunity\nwhen the ship plunged and the stern\nrose, swinging with the ring, he grasp\ned at it, caught it and this time passed\nthe rope through it.\nHalf his work had been done. \'\nAnother wire rope was given him.\nbut how could lie hope, having lost so\nmuch of his strength and benumbed\nby the cold, to succeed when it had\ntaken so long to attach the first rope?\nIt was a period of terrible suspense for\nthose drawing near those dreadful\nbreakers, whose roar was now* every\nmoment growing louder. Again he\nmade his dives; again he clung to the\nrudder, watching to avoid being dash\ned against the ship, trying to put (lie\nsecond rope in place.\nAnd so, sometimes swinging at the\nend of ids rope and sometimes taking\nhis cold baths, he kept on trying. The\nknowledge that lives depended upon\nhis success gave him strength, but\nwhenever he felt tlint lie could not oil\ndure another swing in the blast or an\nother dive in the ocean be would think\nof that life behind bars which was de\nthroning hi.s reason and lie would per\nsevere.\nAt last a feeble call from below an\nnounced to those above that the sec\nond wiro rope had been passed through\n| the ring.

Dlsguisings were common among\nour Gothic ancestors during the Yule\ntide festival. The person hoodwinked\nor blinded—for the monks at one time\nlist\'d their hoods for that purpose—\noften assumed tho appearance of\nsome animal—a goat, a stag, or a cow.\nThis is confirmed by the German Jul\nbok. th° goat of Yuletide, ns well as\nby drrwings in Strutfs “Manners and\nCustoms, and facsimilies of some old\nones in the Rodloian manuscripts. In\nthese the covering for the bead Is\ncomplete, and represents an animal,\nand tin\' game itself is played by\nadults. Prof. Child connects tile game\nwith the northern Odin, the blind\ndeity. In Scotland It is often called\n"Blind Dane”—that, is, hniry. from the\nshaggy animals represented. The\ngame Was not unknown to the Greeks\nand Romans.

To begin with, she\ntook a three years’ course in the State\nAgricultural College at Amherst. She\nhad no money after completing the\nterm, and her health was not of the\nbest. She had been advised to engage\nin some sort of wohk that would keep\nher out of doors, and she rented an\nabandoned farm, borrowing the mon\ney to pay the first Installment of the\nrent.\n“Last year she worked only five\nacres of tv’ tract. She put those five\nacres in garden truck, and she cleared\n$6">0 on the enterprise. She figures\nthat she will clear as much as $200 to\nthe acre on this year\'s farming ope\nrations, and she has purchased three\nhorses and 200 hens. She is doing a\nfairly good business ?n selling eggs.\nSo far tomatoes have been her most\nprofitable crop, but she has also made\na good deal of money bv growing peas\nand corn. During the vegetable season\nshe makes daily trips to Worchester.\nfifteen miles away, where she sells her\nproducts. She hires boys for 10 cents\nan hour to help in the truck patch.\nShe keeps an account of all receipts\nend expenses, an dat the end of the\nyear she will know exactly where she\nstands in a financial way.\n“Her experience illustrates what\nmight be done with thousands of the\nabandoned farms which are scattered\nall over the Eastern States. Farming\nis not easy work. It is a man\'s Job.\nand is not to bo recommended as a !\nvocation for women. To make any\nconsiderable amount of money out of\na year\'s farming requires hard work,\ngood judgment and close economy.\nThis Massacrusetts woman has pros\npered because she attended to busi\nness and because she learned some\nthing about, scientific farming when\nshe was at the agricultural college.\'\nShe is living on a farm, not so much\nfrom chop— as from necessity.
